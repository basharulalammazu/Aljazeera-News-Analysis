"news","Sudan’s army leader al-Burhan appoints former UN official as prime minister","19 May 2025",NA,"Dagalo, who leads the rival Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, also announces a government as war ravages Sudan. Sudan’s army chief and de facto head of state, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has appointed former United Nations official Kamil Idris as prime minister as part of changes to his sovereign council as the nation’s civil war grinds on into its third year. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, critical infrastructure has been destroyed and more than 12 million people have been displaced as a result of the war, which shows no signs of stopping as vying leaders seek to consolidate their power. “The chairman of the sovereignty council issued a constitutional decree appointing Kamil El-Tayeb Idris Abdelhafiz as prime minister,” a statement from Sudan’s ruling Transitional Sovereignty Council read on Monday. Idris, a career diplomat, spent decades at the UN’s World Intellectual Property Organisation and was its director general from 1997 to 2008. He also held various roles in Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and used to serve in the country’s permanent mission to the UN. Idris, whose higher education was in international law and international affairs, also ran as an independent candidate in Sudan’s presidential election in 2010 against longtime military ruler Omar al-Bashir, who was later ousted in a 2019 coup. The new prime minister replaces veteran diplomat Dafallah al-Haj Ali, who was appointed by al-Burhan less than a month ago as acting premier. On Monday, al-Burhan also added two women to the council. The military leader reappointed Salma Abdel Jabbar Almubarak and named Nowara Abo Mohamed Mohamed Tahir to the governing body. The al-Burhan-led military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, have been at war for more than two years after the two generals failed to agree on a plan to integrate their forces. As al-Burhan tried to form an army-led government, Dagalo also announced the formation of a rival administration last month, shortly after signing a charter with allies in Kenya’s Nairobi. The army, which holds areas in the central, eastern and northern parts of Sudan, has managed to claim some military victories in recent months, including taking control of the capital, Khartoum. The RSF, which holds most of the western region of Darfur and some areas in the south with its allied militias, has been striking Port Sudan repeatedly this month to devastating effect. Meanwhile, a worsening humanitarian crisis continues to engulf Sudan. International organisations and some countries have warned of the risks of further escalating the conflict, including in cities like el-Fasher in Darfur that have served as humanitarian aid hubs.

"news","UK, EU reach landmark deal: All you need to know","19 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","The new deal will allow EU boats to continue fishing in UK waters before the first post-Brexit UK-EU summit. The United Kingdom and the European Union cut a breakthrough deal on Monday pertaining to fisheries, trade and security. The deal was finalised hours before a high-level UK-EU summit in London, which seeks to reset Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with Europe. On Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted the first UK-EU summit in London since Brexit. Senior EU officials, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, attended the summit. Brexit is short for “British exit”, and it refers to the UK withdrawing from the then 28-nation trade bloc. In June 2016, a referendum took place where voters were asked whether the UK should leave the EU, and 52 percent of voters preferred the withdrawal. The official exit took place in January 2020. The same year, a Brexit deal with the EU was struck by the Conservative Party led by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The EU is the UK’s largest trading partner. Since Brexit, the UK has seen a 21 percent drop in exports to the EU and a 7 percent drop in imports from the member countries, according to a statement from Starmer’s office on Monday. The deal covers agreements in several sectors, including: Before Brexit, EU nations could fish in British waters, just as UK vessels could hunt for fish in the waters of other European nations. Under a common EU policy, however, there were quotas in place on how much fish could be caught in the waters of any nation to prevent overfishing. Under the 2020 post-Brexit deal, the EU agreed to reduce its fishing quota in UK waters by 25 percent gradually by 2026. In 2026, Britain could choose to completely ban EU ships from fishing in its waters. The deal announced on Monday keeps the 25 percent quota cut, but extends access for EU boats to British waters until 2038. Starmer’s office also announced a 360-million-pound (about $481m) fund to invest in coastal communities. This money will go “towards new technology and equipment to modernise the fleet, training to help upskill the workforce, and funding to help revitalise coastal communities, support tourism and boost seafood exports”, according to Starmer’s office. The EU has agreed to a deal which simplifies checks for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) goods. SPS goods include agricultural products, food and animals. This means some routine border checks on plant and animal products will be dropped on both sides. In a post on X, Starmer said the EU and the UK will work closely on security matters by sharing intelligence. This includes sharing facial recognition data. Britons on holiday will be able to use e-gates – the automated entry and exit gates – at more European airports to avoid long queues at immigration counters. The UK and the EU will link their carbon markets – trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought – to avoid carbon taxes. “Combined, the SPS and Emissions Trading Systems linking measures alone are set to add nearly £9 billion [$12bn] to the UK economy by 2040, in a huge boost for growth,” the statement from 10 Downing Street said on Monday. The EU and the UK are also agreeing to work together on a youth mobility scheme, which would allow young people, below the age of 30, from the UK and the EU to live and work in each other’s territory for a limited period. Such a scheme would be “capped and time-limited”, according to Starmer’s office. However, details of this programme have not been unveiled yet. Starmer posted a 10-point thread on his X account on Monday, underlining multiple ways the “deal with the EU will benefit Britain”. He claimed the deal will lower food prices by easing agricultural trade with the EU; bring down energy bills; strengthen border security; reduce waiting times at airports; ensure a “more secure Britain” with more jobs in the defence industry; save UK businesses from carbon taxes; save the UK steel industry; and combat terrorism and organised crime due to intelligence sharing. “We rolled up our sleeves to deliver what the last government couldn’t,” wrote Starmer. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch voiced concerns about the deal in an X post, specifically hitting out at the extended period for which EU fishing ships will have access to British waters. “We’re becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again. And with no details on any cap or time limits on Youth Mobility, fears of free movement returning will only increase. This is very concerning.” 12 years access to British waters is three times longer than the govt wanted. We’re becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again. And with no details on any cap or time limits on Youth Mobility, fears of free movement returning will only increase. This is very concerning. https://t.co/QzocW3QOwU — Kemi Badenoch (@KemiBadenoch) May 19, 2025  Nigel Farage, leader of the far-right Reform UK party, posted on X about the deal, saying: “If true that will be the end of the fishing industry.” If true that will be the end of the fishing industry. https://t.co/jUIH7ZlCpj — Nigel Farage MP (@Nigel_Farage) May 19, 2025  The Scottish Fishermen’s Federation (SFF) has deemed the deal “a horror show for Scottish fishermen”, according to a statement by Elspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the SFF. Macdonald said the new deal is “far worse than Boris Johnson’s botched Brexit agreement”, adding, “This highlights the total indifference of the British political establishment to the interests of our fishing sector.” “Any attempt by either the UK or EU to portray the new deal as a continuation of existing arrangements would be a lie,” said the statement, published on the SFF website. Both the Conservative Party and Reform UK have previously demanded more control for the UK over its waters. However, Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats party, called out Conservative leaders criticising the deal. “Social media this morning is a zombie apocalypse of dinosaur Tory politicians and right wing hangers-on hankering after the nasty Brexit wars of the last decade.

"news","Gaza’s Khan Younis latest focus of Israeli forced displacement, bombing","19 May 2025",NA,"Israeli army warns of ‘unprecedented’ assault on the southern city as dozens killed in strikes across blockaded enclave. Israel’s military has issued another forced displacement order to residents of Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis, threatening an “unprecedented” assault after launching a wave of deadly strikes on the area and pressing a punishing new ground offensive. The displacement order, posted on X by the military’s Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee on Monday, also applies to the nearby areas of Bani Suhaila and Abasan. It calls on Palestinians to move west towards al-Mawasi. “From this moment, Khan Younis governorate will be considered a dangerous combat zone,” the post read. It comes a day after Israel’s military issued a separate displacement order for areas of central Gaza, including the town of al-Qarara, as its expanded offensive continues. The new order also comes as Israeli forces continue to pound the blockaded enclave, where a famine is looming. There have been at least 30 air strikes in the Khan Younis area Monday as Israel hammered the vastly destroyed territory from north to south, killing at least 71 people since dawn, medical sources tell Al Jazeera. Previous forced evacuation orders throughout Israel’s 19-month war have displaced the majority of Gaza’s population multiple times. Many Palestinians have been bombarded again after fleeing to Israeli-designated “safe zones”, including al-Mawasi. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said Monday’s displacement order “signals a potential full-scale attack” in Khan Younis. “Many families are in a state of chaos. They are trying to get whatever they can from their properties and move to al-Mawasi, where the Israeli military has instructed them to go to,” Abu Azzoum said, adding that an attack targeting al-Mawasi earlier in the day had killed two people. “The repeated issuance of evacuation orders has shattered any sense of safety for Palestinians,” Abu Azzoum said. Israeli forces carried out a massive operation earlier in the war that left much of Khan Younis in ruins. Al-Mawasi, where tens of thousands of people have fled, has also been repeatedly targeted by deadly Israeli strikes. Under the newly launched air and ground offensive, Israel said it plans to displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and secure limited aid distribution inside the territory – something that has been widely criticised by aid groups and the United Nations. In a video message on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military is to “take control of the entire territory of the Gaza Strip”.    He said a plan to let “minimal” aid into Gaza is aimed at alleviating pressure from allies, who, he said, cannot tolerate “images of … mass hunger”. It remains unclear when the aid will be allowed to enter the Palestinian territory, where two million Palestinians are “starving”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned. Israel has kept Gaza under a total blockade since early March, pushing the population there into famine as the healthcare system remains under Israeli attack and is quickly crumbling as its access to medical equipment, supplies and fuel has been cut off. Meanwhile, the al-Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades, the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees, a Palestinian group in Gaza, has confirmed that one of its commanders, Ahmed Sarhan, was killed in Khan Younis. Sarhan was killed in an undercover operation backed by Israeli drones and jets early on Monday. The group said Israeli special forces tried to capture the commander, but he was killed in a shootout after he fought back.

"news","Moscow outlaws Amnesty International for ‘Russophobia’ amid Ukraine war","19 May 2025",NA,"Amnesty International said the decision taken by Moscow is part of its ‘broader effort to silence dissent’. Russian authorities have designated Amnesty International as an “undesirable” organisation, alleging that the rights group propagates pro-war content backed by the Western allies of Ukraine, in the latest crackdown on Kremlin critics. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office said in a statement on Monday that Amnesty’s London office has acted as a “centre for the preparation of global Russophobic projects paid for by accomplices of the Kyiv regime”, according to state-run media. It claimed that since the start of the war in February 2022, Amnesty has been “doing everything possible to intensify the military confrontation in the region”, including by “insisting on the political and economic isolation of our country”. The office also emphasised that members of the international rights group “support extremist organisations and finance the activities of foreign agents”. Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said the decision taken by Moscow is part of its “broader effort to silence dissent”. “We will continue to work relentlessly to ensure that all those who are responsible for committing grave human rights violations, whether in Russia, Ukraine, or elsewhere, face justice … Put simply, no authoritarian assault will silence our fight for justice. Amnesty will never give up or back down in its fight for upholding human rights in Russia and beyond”, she added. The designation means the international human rights group must stop any work in Russia, and those accused of cooperating with or supporting it will be exposed to criminal prosecution. This could even include anyone who shares Amnesty International’s reports on social media. Russia currently recognises 223 entities as “undesirable” organisations, including some prominent independent, as well as Western-backed news outlets and rights groups. Some of those include Transparency International, Latvia-based outlet Meduza, and US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). Amnesty International was established in 1961 to document and report human rights violations around the globe and campaign for the release of those deemed unjustly imprisoned. The organisation won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, having been recognised “for worldwide respect for human rights” and efforts to combat torture, advocate for prisoners of conscience, and promote global adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In addition to covering human rights violations during the Ukraine war, the group has documented massacres in the Gaza Strip and Israeli apartheid, as well as atrocities in Sudan and many other countries.    Moscow has intensified its crackdown on human rights groups and civil society organisations as relations with the West plummeted over the Ukraine war and the expansion of NATO. This has included expanding the “undesirable” and “foreign agent” designations to shut down opposing voices, as well as the suppression of some minority groups’ rights. The move on Monday came as US President Donald Trump was due to hold a phone call with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid efforts to end the fighting. The diplomatic efforts follow inconclusive direct talks, the first in three years, between delegations from Ukraine and Russia in Turkiye’s Istanbul on Friday. The brief talks yielded only an agreement to swap 1,000 prisoners of war, according to the heads of both delegations, in what would be their biggest such exchange since the war began. A senior Ukrainian official familiar with the talks said Russian negotiators demanded Kyiv pull its troops out of all its regions claimed by Moscow before they would agree to a ceasefire. That is a red line for Ukraine, and as it stands, Russia does not have full control in those regions.

"news","Gary Lineker leaves BBC amid anti-Semitism row, pro-Palestinian comments","19 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","Britain’s top football host will not front 2026 World Cup coverage for the broadcaster and is ‘bowing out by mutual agreement’ after backlash to a social media post about Zionism. Gary Lineker, a former England captain and the face of football on British television for more than two decades, will leave the BBC, the public broadcaster said in a statement on Monday. Lineker, 64, had been due to cover the 2026 FIFA World Cup for the BBC, but his early departure comes after he apologised last week for sharing a social media post about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat, historically used as an anti-Semitic insult. Lineker said that he deleted the posts after learning of the offensive references. According to multiple British media reports, the high-profile host is “bowing out by mutual agreement”. He rose to become the BBC’s highest-paid star after presenting its Match of the Day (MOTD) highlights show for 25 years. The BBC announced last November that he would step down from MOTD this year, but carry on working for it until 2026. “Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made. Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season,” BBC director general Tim Davie said in a statement. Lineker repeated his apology on Monday, saying he would never consciously repost anything anti-Semitic. “I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am,” he said. “Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.” In recent years, Lineker’s desire to put forward his political views on social media has caused headaches for the BBC, which has strict rules on impartiality. He was temporarily taken off air in 2023 after he criticised the previous government’s immigration policy on social media. In 2018, he opposed Brexit and called for a second referendum. But it was Lineker’s support for the Palestinians affected by the war on Gaza that most recently brought him into conflict with the BBC. Lineker had already caused friction at the public broadcaster when he recently said Israel was to blame for the origins of the Gaza conflict, because it turned the occupied territory into an “outdoor prison”. Speaking on May 9 in an interview with The Telegraph at the Football Business Awards, just days before he was accused of the anti-Semitic social post on X, Lineker expressed that his issues are with the Israeli government rather than Jewish people. “Obviously, October 7 was awful, but it’s very important to know your history and to study the massacres that happened prior to this, many of them against the Palestinian people,” he said in the interview with The Telegraph, which was published last Thursday, on May 15. “Yes, Israelis have a right to defend themselves. But it appears that Palestinians don’t – and that is where it’s wrong. Palestinians are caged in this outdoor prison in Gaza, and now it’s an outdoor prison that they’re bombing,” Lineker added. In the same interview, the TV host also disputed whether Israel could justifiably argue that it was still acting in self-defence. “I understand that they needed to avenge, but I don’t think they’ve helped their own hostage situation at all,” Lineker said. “People say it’s a complex issue, but I don’t think it is. It’s inevitable that the Israeli occupation was going to cause massive problems, and I just feel for the Palestinians.” The former striker played for England for eight years until 1992 and had been a top scorer for Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur in the 1980s and early 1990s. He is also the co-founder of a podcasting production business, Goalhanger, which makes series such as the podcasts The Rest Is History and The Rest Is Football. Lineker will leave his role at the BBC on Sunday after his final episode of Match of the Day.

"news","Chechnya’s Kadyrov wanted to resign. Or did he?","19 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","The Russian president is said to have denied Kadyrov’s request. The health of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who earlier this month sought to resign, is deteriorating rapidly, sources and observers have told Al Jazeera. But Russian President Vladimir Putin does not want Kadyrov to be succeeded by his third son, they say. Earlier this month, 48-year-old Kadyrov, who has long dubbed himself Putin’s “foot soldier”, said he wanted to quit. “Another [Chechen leader] will have his own initiative, his own vision. I hope my request will be supported,” Kadyrov told a pro-Kremlin publication, Chechnya Today, before his May 7 meeting with Putin. During the meeting in Putin’s office, Kadyrov boasted of 55,000 Chechen servicemen fighting in Ukraine and read a laundry list of economic achievements under his rule in Chechnya, a region home to 1.5 million people. Kadyrov, known as a boxing and weightlifting aficionado, read his words aloud from cards with extra-large print. Neither mentioned the resignation. Kadyrov clarified the issue a day later and habitually glorified Putin. “Whatever I say, no matter how hard I ask, the decision is only made by one person – our Supreme Commander,” Kadyrov, who had streets and districts in Chechnya named after Putin, wrote on Telegram. “I’m a foot soldier. If there’s an order – I follow it.” Two Chechen insiders familiar with the inner workings of Kadyrov’s government told Al Jazeera that, despite the deferential tones, Kadyrov has had a falling-out with Putin over his preferred successor – his third son, Adam Kadyrov, who turned 17 last November. The sources requested anonymity, as rights groups have previously documented a harsh crackdown on dissent in Chechnya, including the persecution of Kadyrov critics and their loved ones. “Putin refused to have Adam as a successor,” one of the sources said. In 2023, Ramzan posted a video purporting to show his son in a pretrial detention centre assaulting a Russian man who had burned a copy of the Quran. Ramzan said he was “proud” of Adam, who federal investigators said cannot face assault charges because of his age. The younger Kadyrov has been appointed to several official positions, including head of Chechnya’s security council. But according to one of the sources, he has been “raised as a prince” and has limited experience of the “real world”. According to Chechnya’s constitution, no one below 30 can head it. At the time of the 2004 assassination of his father, Akhmat, Ramzan was 28. Akhmat was a mufti and separatist strongman who switched sides after conflicts with puritan separatists who rejected Chechnya’s Sufi traditions. Akhmat was killed in a bomb blast, and Ramzan at the time relied on figureheads before officially becoming Chechnya’s leader in 2007. Adam will turn 30 in 2037. Kadyrov senior reportedly has necrotising pancreatitis, a health condition with a low survival rate, and kidney problems that require frequent dialysis. The sources Al Jazeera interviewed claimed he was hospitalised several times in critical condition, and spends hours in the AiMed Family Clinic in Chechnya’s administrative capital, Grozny, every day and often stays overnight. Kadyrov also resorts to prerecorded videos that are broadcast for several consecutive days to create the illusion of his busy, uninterrupted work schedule, they said. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify their claims, which are consistent with other media reports about Kadyrov’s reported ailing health. The illness has reportedly forced Kadyrov to break unwritten rules. For the first time in two decades, he did not record a television address to congratulate Chechens when the holy month of Ramadan ended in late March. He also did not take part in this year’s February 24 commemorations of the Stalinist 1944 deportation of the entire Chechen community to Central Asia. Kadyrov is “very worried” about his family’s destiny after his death, according to Ansar Dishni of Nyiso, a Telegram channel that publishes insider news from Chechnya. “Of course, the Kremlin has given his family security guarantees, but everything can change because Putin is also not forever,” Dishni told Al Jazeera. So far, Apti Alaudinov, a 51-year-old top security official in Chechnya, is the Kremlin’s preferred successor, the sources said. Alaudinov is a poster boy of Chechens fighting on Russia’s side in Ukraine, even though the forces he commands have been ridiculed for staging videos of “participating” in the hostilities. Al Jazeera reported that these forces barely distinguished themselves in combat and mostly have to police Russia-occupied areas in Ukraine. For years, Kadyrov has been reportedly investing in real estate and businesses in the United Arab Emirates and other Middle Eastern nations, creating a financial haven for his family. Others have followed suit. “Chechens are among our best buyers,” a Russian-speaking real estate agent in Dubai told Al Jazeera. “They show up with bags of cash.” Three decades ago, Chechnya was a hotbed of separatism beset by kidnappings, assassinations and abject poverty. “At one point, some believed that Chechnya’s status as part of the Russian Federation could serve as a guarantee against further degradation of the human rights situation,” Ivar Dale, a senior policy adviser with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a rights watchdog, told Al Jazeera. But after two devastating wars and a decades-long, violent crackdown on “extremism” in the wider North Caucasus region, Chechnya has by far become Russia’s most privileged province. Moscow floods it with federal funds that are reportedly misappropriated by Kadyrov, who has built palatial, heavily fortified residences, boasted a collection of luxurious sports cars and invited champion boxer Mike Tyson, as well as Western celebrities to perform at public concerts on his birthday. Human rights groups accuse him and his personal guards of extrajudicial killings, torture, abduction and the destruction of properties that belong to alleged “extremists”. Dale said Chechnya’s human rights abuses are being replicated in other Russian regions and Russia-occupied parts of Ukraine. “The most horrific abuses in Chechnya have become the standard for Russia in general,” Dale said. Observers believe little will change after Kadyrov’s death and the appointment of his successor. But whoever rules Chechnya next “may try to use Kadyrov’s image in a negative key as a figure the people allegedly got rid of to present himself as a good-willed reformer”, Dishni of the Nyiso Telegram channel concluded.

"news","Tanzanian opposition leader makes defiant appearance at treason trial","19 May 2025",NA,"The trial has added to rising concerns across East Africa about threats to democracy. The leader of Tanzania’s main opposition party has appeared in court at a hearing in an ongoing trial on charges of treason, in which he potentially faces the death penalty. Tundu Lissu issued a message of defiance to supporters on Monday as he took his place in the dock at Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in the capital, Dar-es-Salaam. The trial has added to rising concerns across East Africa about threats to democracy. Lissu entered the courtroom with his fist raised in the air as supporters chanted, “No reforms, no election”, according to a video of the courtroom shared by his Chadema party on X. “We will be fine. … Don’t worry at all,” Lissu said as he addressed supporters. The opposition leader, who came second in the 2020 presidential election, insisted on attending the proceedings in person after being forced to appear via videolink from prison for an earlier hearing on April 24. Lissu, who was shot 16 times in a 2017 attack, was charged with treason last month over what prosecutors said was a speech calling on the public to rebel and disrupt presidential and legislative elections scheduled for October. His Chadema party has been disqualified from this year’s polls after demanding changes to an electoral process that it said favours the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, which has been in power since the country’s independence from British rule in 1961. #NoReformsNoElection pic.twitter.com/DYxD1RauWl — Chadema Tanzania (@ChademaTZ2) May 19, 2025  A series of high-profile arrests has highlighted the rights record of President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who plans to seek re-election in October. She has insisted that the government is committed to respecting human rights. However, several Kenyan rights activists, including a former justice minister, said they were denied entry to Tanzania as they tried to travel to attend Lissu’s trial. The former minister, Martha Karua, a prominent lawyer and opposition politician, and former Supreme Court President Willy Mutunga were among those detained when they landed at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar-es-Salaam, they said on X. Tanzania’s immigration spokesperson Paul Mselle did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “Today was going to be a big day, and we went out there in solidarity,” Karua told the Kenyan broadcaster NTV on Monday after she was denied entry and sent back to Nairobi. “The state cannot be used as a personal tool. You cannot deport people whom you don’t like, who are not aligned to your views.” We, @WMutunga, @Honeyfarsafi and I, have been detained at Julius  Nyerere Airport, Dar es Salaam as we came in for the observance of @TunduALissu’s case. The trip was in solidarity with Tanzania lawyers and human rights defenders. They have not given reasons for the detention. pic.twitter.com/ad8UVtT4me — husseinkhalid (@husskhalid) May 19, 2025  Mutunga and rights activist Hussein Khalid were being held in an interrogation room at Julius Nyerere airport on Monday and were expected to be deported, Khalid said on X. Karua said last month that Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were “collaborating” in their “total erosion of democratic principles” amid rising concerns regarding democracy across East Africa. Ethiopia’s leading opposition party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, was banned from any political activity last week, before elections due by June 2026 at the latest. South Sudan has repeatedly delayed holding its first national elections, and President Salva Kiir has placed longtime rival First Vice President Riek Machar under house arrest.

"news","Car bomb in Pakistan’s restive southwest kills four people","19 May 2025",NA,"The attack is just the latest in Balochistan, which is plagued by insurgency. A car bomb that has exploded near a market in Pakistan’s restive southwest has killed four people and wounded 20, according to a government official. The attack was near a market in Qillah Abdullah, a city in the province of Balochistan, Deputy Commissioner Abdullah Riaz said on Monday. The province bordering Afghanistan is plagued by violence mounted by separatist groups. The blast on Sunday night damaged several shops and the outer wall of a building housing paramilitary forces, the official said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. A spokesperson for the Balochistan government condemned the attack and said an investigation is under way. Local security official Ghulab Khan told the AFP news agency that an improvised explosive device (IED) had been planted in a parked car, suggesting that the target was the paramilitary site but the attack was bungled. “It seems the IED exploded before reaching its intended destination,” he said. “All those killed are civilian passers-by.”    Balochistan has long been plagued by violence with an array of separatist groups staging attacks, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which was designated as a “terrorist organisation” by the United States in 2019. The local chapter of ISIL (ISIS) has also increased its activities in recent months. The attack in Qillah Abdullah came days after four paramilitary officials were killed in the province. Two weeks ago, seven army soldiers were killed when their vehicle was targeted by an IED. In March, BLA fighters killed 33 people, mostly soldiers, during an assault on a train carrying hundreds of passengers. Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in violence in its regions bordering Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has accused its western neighbour of allowing its territory to be used to launch attacks, a claim the Taliban has denied. Pakistan has also often accused India of supporting the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban. In a rare move this month, the BLA sought Indian support against Pakistan. The appeal in a May 11 statement came amid heightened tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours. “If we receive political, diplomatic and defense support from the world – especially from India – the Baloch nation can eliminate this terrorist state and lay the foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and independent Balochistan,” the BLA said. It assured New Delhi that its fighters, if backed, would open another front against Pakistan’s military near Afghanistan, where the Pakistani Taliban has strongholds. So far, India has not officially responded to the overture.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/19/car-bomb-in-pakistans-restive-southwest-kills-four-people"
"news","Romania, Poland, Portugal election results: Who are the winners and losers?","19 May 2025",NA,"Pro-EU forces prevail on electoral ‘super Sunday’, but far right gains ground. Millions of voters across three European countries cast their ballots in an electoral “super Sunday” over the weekend amid fears of far-right gains, particularly in Romania and Poland. However, the centrists held their ground in the two European Union and NATO member nations bordering war-torn Ukraine, providing a boost to the West. Portugal’s centre-right governing party also secured a parliamentary win, but the far right made record gains. Brussels can breathe a cautious sigh of relief after pro-EU candidates emerged victorious in the three bellwether elections. But while the centre is holding for now, far-right populist forces continue to grow in all three countries, the latest in a string of far-right surges in Europe. Last summer, EU elections witnessed a clear turn to the right in the European Parliament, shaking up governments across the 27-member bloc and leaving mainstream political parties at a crossroads. Despite “super Sunday” results, eurosceptic parties continue to garner support. Romania’s presidential election concluded with a clear victory for centrist candidate Nicusor Dan, who secured 54 percent of the vote against nationalist rival George Simion’s 46 percent. The closely watched contest, which has geopolitical implications for the EU, drew the country’s highest electoral turnout in 25 years, with about 65 percent of eligible voters casting their ballots. The election was marked by a dramatic comeback for Dan, the 55-year-old mayor of Bucharest, who trailed in the early stages but surged ahead in the final days of the ballot. Dan, a former mathematician, pledged to clamp down on corruption and support the EU and NATO. Simion ran a campaign rooted in euroscepticism and nationalist rhetoric, pledging to halt military aid to Ukraine and overturn the ruling establishment in a style similar to United States President Donald Trump. His early lead raised fears among liberal segments of the population, but as results came in, it became clear that voters had rallied behind Dan’s vision of a centrist Romania. Coming on the heels of the annulment of a previous vote in December, due to alleged Russian interference, the stakes of Sunday’s election were very high. Many saw the contest as a referendum on Romania’s future political direction and its role within the EU and NATO. The high turnout reflected a pushback against rising right-wing populism, reinforcing Romania’s Western orientation at a time of regional instability. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was quick to congratulate the pro-EU winner, saying Dan’s victory would help work towards “a strong Europe”. Looking ahead, Dan plans to form a coalition with both centre-left and centre-right parties, aiming to stabilise the political landscape and deliver on his promises of reform. Speaking to private television station Digi24, Dan said he wanted a new coalition government to include all four centre-right and centre-left parliamentary parties. According to a second exit poll released late on Sunday night, Rafal Trzaskowski, a deputy leader of Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s centrist Civic Platform (PO) party, won 31.1 percent of the vote. Karol Nawrocki of the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party came in second, with 29.1 percent of the vote. The vote was also a referendum on Tusk’s government, formed in December 2023 after ending the PiS’s eight-year rule, which was marked by undermining of the judiciary and the media. If the election result – not expected until later today – goes as suggested by the exit poll, Trzaskowski and Nawrocki will compete in a second-round run-off on June 1, with neither winning more than 50 percent in the first round. Meanwhile, other candidates in the first round – including Slawomir Mentzen from the far-right Confederation Party and Magdalena Biejat from the Lewica (The Left) party – will be eliminated. “There is a lot, a lot, of work ahead of us, and we need determination,” Trzaskowski told supporters on Sunday night. He cautioned that the real work of government had just begun, given the deep political polarisation within Polish society. Commenting on X, Prime Minister Tusk, who has forged a pro-European track, said the next two weeks would decide the future of Poland. Meanwhile, Nawrocki’s camp emphasised the need to prevent what it described as a “monopoly on power” by the Civic Coalition. Social issues dominated the campaign trail, with Nawrocki framing himself as a guardian of conservative values, while Trzaskowski drew support from voters for his pledges to back abortion and LGBTQ rights. Both camps are now focused on mobilising supporters and appealing to the voters of the likely eliminated candidates as the decisive run-off seems likely. The president in Poland wields the power to veto laws, so the winner will have direct influence over whether Tusk’s pro-EU government can implement its agenda. Foreign policy, judicial reform and civil rights are all at stake. A Trzaskowski victory in the second round could enable Tusk’s government to implement an agenda that includes rolling back judicial changes introduced by PiS that critics say have undermined the independence of the courts. However, if Nawrocki wins, the impasse that has existed since Tusk became prime minister in 2023 will continue. In Portugal, the parliamentary election saw the governing centre-right Democratic Alliance (AD), led by Prime Minister Luis Montenegro, take 89 seats in the 230-seat parliament, well short of 116 needed for a majority. The party garnered 32.7 percent of the vote. The Socialist Party (PS) and the far-right Chega party finished even in second place, both securing 58 seats. The Socialists suffered significant losses compared with the previous elections, prompting party leader Pedro Nuno Santos to resign. With the results of several seats yet to be called, Chega might emerge as the main opposition party. Chega, which ran on an anti-immigration platform, won a record 22.6 percent of the vote, an impressive rise from the 1.3 percent it received in its debut election in 2019. “We didn’t win these elections, but we made history,” Chega leader Andre Ventura told the AFP news agency. “The system of two-party rule in Portugal is over,” Ventura, who is a former sports commentator on television, said. Chega’s surge, meanwhile, underscored the growing traction of far-right politics in Portugal, while the Liberal Initiative (IL) also made gains, securing nine seats. “The people want this government and this prime minister,” Montenegro told his cheering supporters after the results were announced. But even with the backing of the upstart business-friendly party IL, the AD would still need the support of Chega to pass legislation. For his part, though, Montenegro, a 52-year-old former lawyer, has refused any alliance with the anti-establishment party, saying it is “unreliable” and “not suited to governing”. The vote was dominated by inflation, housing and immigration issues. The vote’s outcome raises the prospects of legislative gridlock or the need for ad hoc agreements on key policies, which would complicate an already tricky political backdrop in the country of 10.6 million people. Sunday’s election, the third in as many years, was called after Montenegro failed to win a parliamentary vote of confidence in March. He was forced to call the snap election after the opposition questioned his integrity over the dealings of his family’s consultancy firm. He has denied any wrongdoing. Montenegro’s government will need to carefully navigate policy priorities and build consensus across party lines, all while trying to maintain public trust and address persistent economic and social concerns.

"news","Military and economic deals in pipeline as UK looks to EU reset","19 May 2025",NA,"London and Brussels agree to remove selected post-Brexit barriers as Trump’s global disruptions drive return to closer ties. The United Kingdom and the European Union are close to concluding agreements to boost military and trade ties as they seek to mend ties disturbed by Brexit. The British government announced on Monday that new agreements had been sealed on defence cooperation, food trade and border checks. The announcement came as Prime Minister Keir Starmer prepared to host the leaders of the 27-member EU, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa in the first formal summit since the UK left the bloc in 2020. The two sides reached the agreements after talks in the British capital extended overnight into Monday with an eye on removing barriers as they navigate a shifting world order under the influence of United States President Donald Trump. A defence and security pact is expected to allow Britain access to a 150-billion-euro ($169bn) loan programme to rearm Europe. NATO allies are dealing with significant uncertainties over the Trump administration’s commitment to the military alliance. In particular, Europe is eyeing the ramifications of more than three years of Russia’s war on Ukraine with Trump having established direct talks with Moscow while sidelining Kyiv, Brussels and London. The urge to reset ties was made clear as the UK offered a major concession on fishing that will allow EU vessels access to British waters for 12 years. UK vessels will have the same access to EU waters. As part of the deal, there will also be a permanent reduction in paperwork and border checks that have come about as a result of the UK leaving the EU five years ago. The restrictions had mostly hampered small food producers from exporting to Europe. The British government believes the agreement will boost trade and help create more jobs in the UK. British travellers are also expected to reap the benefits of faster e-gates access at EU airports. Amid heavy criticism from the opposition, especially pro-Brexit voices, Starmer said it is time for the UK to look forward and “move on from the stale old political fights and to find common sense, practical solutions that improve the lives of British people”. “Secure borders. Cheaper bills. More jobs,” he wrote in a post on X. “We will close a deal in the national interest.” Well before the prime minister welcomed EU leaders on Monday, political opponents like Andrew Griffith, who represents the opposition Conservative Party on trade and business, began calling the event the “surrender summit”. Longtime Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage decried a “betrayal” by the British government, especially around the issue of giving the EU fishing access to UK waters. Polls have shown that a majority of Britons now regret leaving the EU in a 2016 referendum, in which 52 percent of voters chose Brexit and 48 percent voted against it. But there has also been reluctance to rejoin. The new deals with the EU come on the heels of agreements struck by London with Washington and New Delhi. This month, the US and the UK reached a deal to ease some tariffs, create an aluminium and steel trading zone, and secure a pharmaceutical supply chain. The UK said its deal with India was expected to boost bilateral trade by 25.5 billion pounds ($34bn) annually by 2040 while giving a considerable boost to the automotive and alcohol industries and easing some specific visa allowances for professional workers.

"news","To love a child who joined ISIS","19 May 2025","Nils Adler","A story of a father bearing the weight of his son's decision—grieving in silence, plagued by guilt, fighting to free his grandchildren from detention. Stockholm, Sweden and Northeast Syria - In late September 2014, Aaden*, a sociable, middle-aged father of five, got a call from two intelligence agents asking to meet with him. The two casually-dressed women from the Swedish Security Service (Sapo) were polite and reassuring. They were responding to a panicked call Aaden had made to emergency services about a week earlier. He had phoned for help after his son Damaal* called him from southern Turkiye to say he was about to cross the border into Syria to join ISIL, also known as ISIS. ""But you’ll die!"" Aaden had pleaded with his son. ""Maybe. But I’m strong, thanks to you,"" came the response. Frustrated, Aaden asked the Sapo agents to help him understand how Damaal was ""radicalised"". They told him they were as surprised as he was. Damaal, unlike many other ISIL recruits, had never been flagged in their system. Urging Aaden to contact them if he heard from Damaal, they said goodbye. It would not be long before they spoke again.  It was Christmas Eve last year when the Somali Swedish mechanical engineer, now in his mid-60s, first invited Al Jazeera into the family’s spacious apartment overlooking an expanse of snow-covered forest. He prepared an elaborate selection of cakes and desserts, cups of Turkish tea and very strong coffee. Exuding a nervous energy, he fidgeted with the sofa cushions as he rushed to and from the kitchen to grab a sugar bowl, even though it was not needed. Finally sitting down, he started talking about the flood of conflicting emotions that engulfed him still, even 10 years later. He was intensely angry at his son for joining ISIL and traumatising the family. He was also a father who loved his son unconditionally. Eyes drifting to the large window looking out onto the forest, he relived that September day, the urge to reach into the phone and take his son in his arms, just as he had three days earlier when they last had dinner together. For Aaden, ISIL represents everything he hates after similar armed groups, like al-Shabab, ruined much of his beloved homeland. After Somalia's 1991 civil war, his prestigious job with the United Nations no longer existed. He managed to move to Sweden, where it took two years of bureaucratic wrangling to get his wife and two children to join him. Taking any job he could find, even working as a cleaner, he supported them while studying every evening to master Swedish and earn his mechanical engineering degree. The family soon expanded, with three more babies, and Aaden secured a well-paid job. After years of struggle, Aaden had a stable home and financial security, and looked forward to a peaceful family life. Picking up a photo album from the coffee table, he absently patted the photo of a graduating Damaal on the cover as he looked around. He lives alone, having separated from his wife almost 20 years ago. The two remain such good friends, and are so often at each other's homes, that Aaden says many people assume they are still married. Going from anger to despair, Aaden described talking to Damaal several times in the two days after that first call from Turkiye. He tried desperately to persuade Damaal to come home, but his son was determined, repeating that he was going to help children injured by Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. In the midst of Aaden’s despair, Sapo kept calling to ask if he had any updates. Wanting to do the right thing and believing that the agents had his family’s best interests at heart, Aaden would always oblige, patiently answering their string of follow-up questions. By late 2014, Aaden had his own Sapo handlers who would visit him at work for ""fikas"" - a Swedish coffee break with cinnamon buns and small talk - in his office canteen. He is still cautious when discussing the details of the calls and visits, but said he grew fond of his Sapo contacts. Eventually, he was assigned a single handler, a well-spoken man in his 60s who would calm him down gently when Aaden became stressed or began fretting over who could have convinced his son to join ISIL. They became close. He felt understood.  Damaal was a ""scrawny"" kid - a picky eater with a gentle disposition who always tried to resolve family arguments. He was a good kid, Aaden said, patting the album on his lap. He never had to tell Damaal off, and, other than nagging the boy to eat better, he never had to worry about him getting into trouble or messing up at school. If I die, make sure to look after my children, Dad Damaal grew up football-mad - a staunch Liverpool supporter. He would pick up injured animals to nurse back to health and developed an interest in birds, begging his father to visit his favourite look-out spot and studiously learning their names from a birdwatcher's handbook Aaden bought him. Remaining a very slim teenager, Damaal was rejected from compulsory military service when he graduated from high school. But he started working out when he went to university, Aaden said, and began to bulk up. Aaden opened the photo album and pointed to photos of Damaal at graduation. A smiling 18-year-old beamed up from the pages, with a perfectly groomed moustache and a sharp suit. He is smiling, hugging friends and teachers, and spraying champagne. In his hand is a baby photo of himself that a relative printed onto a placard. The photos were taken just 18 months before Damaal called his dad from Turkiye. He spent those months focusing on his medical studies at the university, living in a modest student apartment nearby that Aaden helped pay for. But he came home regularly to eat his favourite homemade Somali meals and spend time with his family, who often gathered in Aaden’s apartment. It is not clear how Damaal was recruited, but Aaden insisted that he was brainwashed, lured by ISIL recruiters who wanted Damaal’s medical skills and took advantage of the fact that he always wanted to heal the injured. Damaal spoke calmly during those phone calls in September 2014. Most of the time, he seemed sure of his decision, but there were a few moments that had given Aaden hope - moments when Damaal seemed to hesitate. Then, for a while, the calls abruptly stopped. In January 2015, a still-calm Damaal called home and told his dad he was in northern Iraq, working in an ISIL-controlled hospital. He kept calling, whenever he could, and updating his father about his life. There were two marriages, the first a marriage of convenience to ""protect"" a woman he met in Syria from being ""married off"" to a fighter she did not want to wed. By the time of the siege of Raqqa, she had smuggled herself out, unknowingly pregnant with a child she delivered months later. Although she maintains good relations with Damaal’s family, she told Al Jazeera she prefers not to talk about her time in Syria. Damaal then lived with his other wife, Aamiina. The couple eventually had three children. By 2016, they were living in the Syrian city of Raqqa just as the United States-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) began to seize large chunks of territory from ISIL in a series of bloody battles. Aaden implored his son to leave as Raqqa came under siege from the ground and the air in 2017. ""It’s too late for that,"" Damaal said. ""If I die, make sure to look after my children, Dad,"" he said anxiously during a particularly violent bombardment.  As the SDF closed in on Raqqa, Aaden's new handler - a polite and eager younger agent who had replaced his now-retired previous handler - called more frequently. Just before Raqqa was seized by the SDF in 2017, Damaal and his family managed to flee to Baghouz, five hours along the road east, towards Iraq. There, in ISIL's last stronghold, Aamiina gave birth to their third child, Damaal relayed in worried tones over the phone. His friends were dying, he told Aaden in early 2019. If I could survive the siege of Raqqa, I can survive anything There was a band of Swedes who spent most of their time together. One of them, well-known ISIL recruiter Michael Skramo, had been shot in the neck as he was digging a ditch to shelter him and his seven children from air strikes. The bullet went through Skramo's neck and out of his upper back, leaving him paralysed - details that were later confirmed to Al Jazeera by another witness. Damaal tried to nurse the badly injured man. He told his father that Skramo would strain to whisper ""v"", which the Swedes eventually realised was him trying to say ""vatten"", Swedish for water. Skramo, who had been his best friend, died two days later in Damaal’s arms. On the phone, Damaal told his dad: ""I see people dying, houses crumbling, but I’m standing here on the street, and I’m not even injured."" ""Do you have death anxiety?"" he asked his son. ""Yes, but if I could survive the siege of Raqqa, I can survive anything,"" Damaal replied. Then, the phone calls stopped again. Sapo’s calls had reached a crescendo in early 2019 as ISIL collapsed, losing all its territory. After the collapse, Sapo fell silent too. Damaal, his wife and their children had been arrested, but the family found out only when they spotted Damaal being lined up by SDF fighters in the background of a news report in March 2019. Aaden desperately called his contacts at Sapo, but no one picked up or called him back.  Aaden needed to find his son. So began his desperate battle with Swedish authorities to find out what had happened to Damaal, his wife and children. He called every relevant government department, demanding, then pleading, that someone tell him if his son was alive, where he was, and where his family was. But he ran up against one brick wall after another - Sapo had gone silent, as had the Foreign Ministry, which only sent sporadic, generic email responses saying it could not help. He also sought the help of Repatriate the Children Sweden (RTC), a rights organisation founded in 2020 that aims to raise awareness about the children detained in northeast Syria. It was 2021 before he got proof of life, a short note from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) that said his son was ""safe and well"". Aaden had clung to those words for three years, he told Al Jazeera. But it was not enough. He needed to know how his son was doing. After several conversations, Aaden agreed to facilitate a visit to Aamiina and the three children in Syria’s Roj detention camp, where they were being held. But he also wanted someone to visit his son in prison to check on him.  Aamina spends her days confined, and managing her children’s confinement. The 30-something-year-old feels lucky to have made friends in the Roj detention camp, a group of Somali-British detainees who taught her English and help her look after her children, a favour she reciprocates. Their living arrangement is a bit better than others, too, thanks to the money her extended family sends her. She used $150 to buy an additional tent, setting the two up to create a small inner courtyard where her seven-year-old son can run around and expend some of his boundless energy. They also have a television, on which the children watch nature documentaries - a ""window to the outside world"" for children who have known nothing but detention camps their entire lives. Whenever they see a new animal or landscape, the children are full of wonder and questions, and her eldest, a nine-year-old girl, picks up her colours to draw dramatic and abstract interpretations of the world outside the camp. Aamiina is their constant companion, even homeschooling them with books she borrows from the camp's educational facility. She had liked school as a kid, especially history class, and it makes her sad that her children do not feel safe going to the camp school because the teachers scream at them, and the other kids always want to fight. Trying to create a sense of normalcy, she makes dinner every night as her son watches cartoons after his lessons. Using whatever she has available, she experiments with recipes, a passion she developed in the camp. She manages to rustle up quite a few dishes in her rudimentary cooking space, sometimes making her favourite, lasagne, or the children's favourite, pancakes. When she is feeling homesick, she will make Swedish meatballs. As smells waft out from her cooking space, she can usually count on one or both of their cats to come and investigate. An animal lover all her life, Aamiina had adopted the two cats in the camp, taking care of them, playing with them, and keeping them around her and the children, who love them dearly. Overall, things in Roj are marginally better than they were in the al-Hol detention camp, a three-hour drive to the south, where she and the children spent the first year and a half of their captivity. But in early 2025, the guards in Roj seemed to get jumpy, raiding more tents and, she heard, even shooting a woman in the hand for trying to smuggle herself out. One night in February, it was taking her longer than usual to get her two daughters and son to bed. They had heard a visitor was coming to see them the next day, and were excited to meet someone from outside the camp. Then, camp security raided their tent, frightening the children, who took even longer to fall asleep. The next morning, when guards arrived to take them to meet Al Jazeera in the administration office, they felt scared and decided to stay with their neighbours instead. Aamiina pulled on a face mask and headed out with the guards into the damp, windy day. The tension in the sparsely furnished administration office was palpable. Aamiina, softly spoken and slightly built, fidgeted with her mask as she introduced herself in English, exchanging glances with a stone-faced female guard. She had forgotten all her Swedish in the more than 10 years she spent in Syria, she said. Still nervous, she started talking about herself, sharing a brief account of how she travelled from Somalia to Sweden as an unaccompanied minor when she was 11 and was granted permanent residency shortly after. She spent seven years in her adopted homeland before travelling to ISIL-controlled territory in 2014, when she was 20, a decision she said she would not speak about. Aamiina said she has done her best with the children, but is mindful that their chances of integrating into a society outside the camp diminish rapidly as they grow older. She believes they must leave the camp soon if they are to stand a chance of living a normal life. ""It's sad because I came from Sweden. I don't even have Somali citizenship. [The children] are Swedish... and they are supposed to be there,"" she said. Then, with the guard distracted for a minute, Aamiina suddenly began speaking urgently in fluent Swedish. ""They [the guards] play nice now, but that’s not how they are with us,"" she said. ""My son can’t go to the camp fence because he says they’ll shoot him."" Roj, where 2,600 women and children are held, is a smaller and marginally cleaner version of the al-Hol camp, which holds about 40,000 people displaced by ISIL or related to ISIL fighters. But it has poor sanitation and lacks access to health services, Aamiina said, adding that her eldest daughter has been chronically fatigued and underweight for years. The charity Save the Children paid for medical tests at a nearby hospital, but the results were inconclusive. ""If we were back in Sweden, I’m sure we could find out what’s wrong with her in a day,"" she added. As the meeting drew to a close and camp guards ushered her out, she whispered: ""Please try and meet my husband. ""No one has heard from him for a long time.""  The next morning, a prisoner shuffled into an office in an SDF military compound in Hasakah, northeast Syria, handcuffed and with a hood made from sacking material over his head. He was tall and walked with a limp, and the legs of his stained brown jumpsuit were rolled up, revealing scars down his shin. A guard removed the bag from the prisoner's head, and he squinted in the light as he was told to sit down on a blue and beige sofa. It was not Damaal. Al Jazeera had asked to meet Damaal, but it was neither possible to raise the issue at that moment nor to appear too curious about him. As the guard unbound his hands, the prisoner introduced himself as Erik*, a 34-year-old Swedish bus driver who had travelled to join ISIL in 2014. Erik’s face had been badly injured, and he was blind in his right eye, a result, he said, of an air strike on his former home in Raqqa. He appeared older than his age, and his hair had begun to grey - something he attributed to being separated from his wife and daughter, who had been repatriated to Sweden after stints in al-Hol and Roj. He was calm, however, and happy to answer questions, volunteering that the cramped conditions in the prison had improved with the recent installation of air conditioning. Then he brought up Damaal, whom he said he knew well. They had lived together in Baghouz in early 2019. His description of Damaal fitted with Aaden's: a calm, quiet man who avoided conflict and whose personality was at odds with many of the other battle-hardened members of the group. Damaal had told the other prisoners about his father, Erik said, and it had given him hope that if he ever made it back to Sweden, he could also pursue an education and succeed. They had been in different prison cells, but they saw each other now and then during their captivity. Damaal had told Erik that he was struggling with a chest infection but had appeared to recover. Then Erik heard from other inmates that the condition had returned, and Damaal had died in November 2022. Pressed subtly on the matter, he insisted that he was sure, adding, ""I miss him."" Al Jazeera reached out to the relevant Swedish authorities. The Swedish Foreign Ministry responded that it ""cannot confirm whether a Swedish citizen has died in Syria"". Sapo stated that it was ""not able to provide any answers"".  Aaden sat quietly on a sofa, listening intently as he was told what Erik had said about Damaal. He had been anxiously waiting for this meeting, sending numerous messages asking how his son was doing. Now, his sadness enveloped him, along with a bitter disappointment that the authorities had refused to confirm if his son had died and give his family the closure it deserved. Holding back tears, he insisted that everyone, including the social worker who had come to the meeting, eat some of the cakes and biscuits he had laid out as he poured tea for everyone. Damaal’s physical strength had always been an issue, he said. Growing up, he and his wife had struggled to get their son to eat well enough, and he had often fretted that his boy would succumb to illness in prison. The family would now need to grieve, retreating into themselves because they could not talk about their sadness as they mourned the loss of someone who was part of ISIL. That shame is something Damaal’s older sister, Almas*, finds difficult to accept because she will always remember Damaal as the ""most wonderful little brother"" who was kind, funny and helpful. Over the phone from her apartment in Stockholm, she said that since the 2021 proof of life via the ICRC, the family had wondered if he was still alive. Now, they have to get over another shock, she said, that of their own government not telling them what happened to Damaal, and that the news had come instead from a fellow prisoner, via Al Jazeera. For now, she said, the family is focused on bringing back Aamiina and her children, whom she feels a ""strong connection and love for"". But Almas and the family know it will not be easy. They believe non-ethnic Swedes who joined ISIL are being treated differently by the authorities than ethnic Swedes who did the same. Almas said this was reflected in Swedish media, which portrayed the ethnic Swedes as ""brainwashed"", while for those from a Muslim background, radicalisation was presented as having ""always been a part of them"". Several families of Swedish ISIL members whom Al Jazeera spoke to agreed with her view. ""It feels very strange because we’re Swedish, even if we have a different ethnicity. I don't have any connection to Somalia as a country. So when you’re not appreciated as a citizen and you don't get the same rights as an ethnic Swedish person, it is hard to digest,"" Almas said. The family will continue to seek confirmation of Damaal's death, Almas and Aaden said, although they believe he is likely dead and they need to focus on his widow and children. Almas, like Aamiina, believes now is a crucial time. If the children come to Sweden soon, they could recover. ""They're still quite young. They can easily learn new things and adapt, but right now, with the eldest's health condition and stunted growth, it's imperative to bring her as soon as possible,"" she said. For Aaden, the Swedish authorities must recognise their moral obligation to repatriate the children with their mother. ""The children are innocent,"" he said. ""They have done nothing to deserve this. They must come home so we can look after them.""  The children have seen families being repatriated from Roj and have begun to ask when their turn will come, Aamiina said. Her oldest often asks how they came to be in the camp, why they cannot see their family abroad, and why her life is not like those of the children she sees on TV. In 2022, the Swedish Foreign Ministry visited Roj and took DNA samples from the children. They matched them with Damaal’s parents in Sweden, which entitled the children to Swedish nationality under Swedish law. The Swedish authorities offered Aamiina a choice: Her children could go to Sweden without her and be placed in foster families. She could not return because the Swedish government had revoked her residency, but they offered no explanation as to why the children would not be able to live with their grandparents or other members of the family. Skramo, Damaal’s best friend, was of Swedish and Norwegian descent. His seven orphaned children, who were held in the al-Hol camp, were repatriated with the support of the Swedish Foreign Ministry in 2019 after their maternal grandfather, Patricio Galvez, embarked on a personal mission to rescue them. Aaden said Galvez was able to garner significant media coverage, which humanised the plight of the Swedish children and support for his cause in a way his family could not. Galvez was not granted custody of his grandchildren by social services, partly, they said, because his public profile would jeopardise the children’s protected identities. However, he is able to have contact with them. UN experts and human rights groups describe open-ended detentions in camps like al-Hol and Roj as a breach of international law. While some scrutiny falls on the authorities administering the camps, repatriating the people detained there remains the responsibility of their home governments. A 2024 UN special procedures report criticised Sweden’s ""offer"" to take Aamiina's children, finding the ""state practice of offering repatriation to children on the condition of permanent separation from their mother to be inconsistent with human rights law"". It also stated that Aamiina and her children were in a ""position of extreme vulnerability and ill health"", and that they ""seem to be detained in inhumane, cruel and degrading conditions"". In December, the Swedish Foreign Ministry responded to the UN, saying Aamiina's residency permit had been revoked and no measures to repatriate her to Sweden were under way. Swedish authorities have stifled repatriation efforts, providing rejections and using language that Louise Dane, a lawyer with the Swedish Refugee Law Centre, said can be misleading. One example, she said, was when she helped Aamiina apply for a new residence permit, but the application was rejected on what Dane said was ""very weak legal reasoning"", suggesting Aamiina is a security threat. Another was her request that the Swedish authorities confirm the children’s citizenship, a simple legal precaution during the repatriation case. The Swedish Migration Agency did not process the application, claiming both children’s parents must sign the papers - impossible since nobody had contact with Damaal. Then, the Swedish Foreign Ministry used that unprocessed citizenship application to give ""the impression that the children might not be Swedish citizens"", in response to the UN report that criticised the Swedish government, Dane said. A 2024 ruling by Denmark's Supreme Court could serve as guidance for Sweden in Aamiina’s case, Beatrice Eriksson, the cofounder and spokesperson for Repatriate the Children Sweden, told Al Jazeera. The ruling overturned Denmark’s decision not to repatriate a woman and her child, a Danish citizen, from Roj because the mother’s citizenship had been revoked after she had travelled to Syria in 2014. The mother was born in Denmark with Somali citizenship and was granted Danish citizenship when she was three. ""Denmark's Supreme Court ruling is based on the European Convention on Human Rights, which Sweden also must follow,"" Eriksson said. ""This is the only way to protect and fulfil the rights of the children and ultimately safeguard their lives. ""After all the suffering they’ve endured, having access to their primary caregiver - unless that would pose a threat to the child - is essential for their healing and reintegration into society."" Aamiina hopes Sweden will reconsider its decision and get her and the children back home. ""No one wants to stay here. It is not a place for humans,"" she said firmly. *Names have been changed to protect the identity of the individual.

"news","DR Congo’s coltan miners struggle as they dig to feed world’s tech","19 May 2025",NA,"In Pictures Despite global thirst for key tech material, miners in rebel-held Rubaya toil in poverty, mired in conflict and unrest. Nestled in the green hills of Masisi territory in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the artisanal Rubaya mining site hums with the sound of generators, as hundreds of men labour by hand to extract coltan, a key mineral crucial for modern electronics and defence technology manufacturing. Rubaya lies in the heart of the eastern DRC, a mineral-rich area of the Central African nation that for decades has been haunted by conflict between government forces and different armed groups, including the Rwanda-backed M23, whose recent resurgence has escalated the violence. As the United States spearheads peace talks between the DRC and Rwanda, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi has sought out a deal with the Trump administration, offering mineral access in return for support in quelling the armed rebellion and boosting security. While details of the deal remain unclear, analysts said Rubaya might be one of the mining sites which fall under its scope. Eastern DRC has been in and out of crisis for decades. The conflict has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with more than seven million people displaced, including 100,000 who fled their homes this year. The Rubaya mines have been at the centre of the fighting, changing hands between the Congolese government and rebel groups. For more than a year, the mines have been controlled by the M23 rebels, who earlier this year advanced and seized the strategic cities of Goma and Bukavu in a major escalation of hostilities. Despite the country’s exceptional mineral wealth, more than 70 percent of Congolese live on less than $2.15 a day. For the men working in Rubaya’s mines, who rely on the mining for their livelihoods, little has changed over decades of violence. “I earn $40 a month, but that’s not enough,” said Jean Baptiste Bigirimana, who has worked in the mines for seven years. “Children need clothes, education and food. When I divide up the money to see how I will take care of my children, I realise it’s not enough,” he said, adding that he does not know where the minerals he mines end up. Coltan — short for columbite-tantalite — is an ore from which the metals tantalum and niobium are extracted. Both are considered critical raw materials by the US, the European Union, China and Japan. Tantalum is used in mobile phones, computers and automotive electronics, as well as aircraft engines, missile components and GPS systems. Niobium is used in pipelines, rockets and jet engines. The DRC produced about 40 percent of the world’s coltan in 2023, according to the US Geological Survey, with Australia, Canada and Brazil being other big suppliers. According to a United Nations report, since seizing Rubaya in April last year, the M23 has imposed taxes on the monthly trade and transport of 120 tonnes of coltan, generating at least $800,000 a month. Experts say it is not easy to trace how coltan arrives in Western countries. Analysts warn that the implementation of a minerals deal in the eastern DRC, if one were to materialise, will face many hurdles, especially with US investors largely abandoning the country in the last two decades. If the deal were to include Rubaya, where all mining is currently done manually, US companies would have to contend with both security concerns and a severe lack of infrastructure. Bahati Moise, a trader who resells coltan from Rubaya’s mines, hopes that, regardless of who controls the mines, the workers who labour to extract the minerals will finally be valued as much as the resources themselves. “The whole country, the whole world knows that phones are made from the coltan mined here, but look at the life we live,” he said. “We can’t continue like this.” Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/5/19/dr-congos-coltan-miners-struggle-as-they-dig-to-feed-worlds-tech"
"news","Rains halt search for gold miners after deadly Indonesian landslide","19 May 2025",NA,"Rescuers battle weather and conditions to find missing after storm kills six people at remote mine. Torrential rains have forced Indonesian rescuers to suspend their efforts to find 14 missing gold miners after a landslide in the remote east of the country killed six of their colleagues. Officials reported on Monday that the weather and difficult terrain were hindering the search for the workers in Indonesia’s easternmost region of Papua. Torrential rain triggered a landslide and floods late on Friday near a small mine run by residents in the Arfak Mountains in West Papua province, Abdul Muhari, a spokesperson for the National Agency for Disaster Management, told the Reuters news agency. The storm swept away temporary shelters used by the miners, killing at least six people and injuring four, he reported. “The floodwaters from upstream hit a temporary housing area of traditional gold miners at around 9:00 pm (1200 GMT),” Muhari said in a statement. The search to locate the missing miners has been hampered by “damaged roads and mountainous tracks as well as bad weather,” said Yefri Sabaruddin, the head of a team of 40 rescuers, including police and military officials. He noted that it took 12 hours to travel to the site from the nearest town. Authorities said they plan to resume their search for the missing on Tuesday. Unlicensed mines are common across the mineral-rich Southeast Asian archipelago nation, where abandoned sites attract locals who hunt for leftover gold ore without proper safety equipment. That leaves them open to accidents as operations located in remote areas and in difficult conditions make it hard for the authorities to regulate them. There was no official indication of the mine’s legal status. Sabaruddin stressed that the focus is on evacuating victims. Indonesia is prone to landslides during the rainy season, typically from November to April. A landslide caused by heavy rains at an illegal gold mine in West Sumatra in September killed 13 people and injured 12. In July, at least 27 people were killed in a landslide near an illegal gold mine on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.

Tens of thousands of red-clad protesters have marched through The Hague to call on the Netherlands government to do more to halt Israel’s onslaught in Gaza. Organisers said it was the country’s biggest demonstration in two decades as rally participants pressed the Dutch government on Sunday to take action against Israel’s genocide in Gaza. The crowd that gathered outside the government seat was estimated to number more than 100,000 people, according to the organisers. Police did not give an estimate. “Sometimes I’m ashamed of the government because it doesn’t want to set any limits,” said 59-year-old teacher Jolanda Nio. “We are calling on the Dutch government: stop political, economic and military support to Israel as long as it blocks access to aid supplies and while it is guilty of genocide, war crimes and structural human rights violations in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories,” said Marjon Rozema of Amnesty International. Israel’s army announced “extensive ground operations” on Sunday as part of its newly expanded campaign in the Gaza Strip. Rescuers reported dozens killed in a wave of Israeli attacks. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 53,339 people and wounded 121,034, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. The enclave’s Government Media Office updated the death toll to more than 61,700, saying thousands of people missing under the rubble are presumed dead. An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, and about 250 were taken captive. The International Court of Justice in The Hague is hearing a case brought by South Africa, arguing that the Gaza war breached the 1948 United Nations Genocide Convention, an accusation Israel has strongly denied.

"news","Lithuania files case against Belarus at ICJ over alleged people smuggling","19 May 2025",NA,"The Baltic nation is seeking damages, including compensation for border reinforcement costs. Lithuania has initiated legal proceedings against Belarus at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing its neighbour of orchestrating a refugee and migrant crisis by facilitating the smuggling of people across their border. “The Belarusian regime must be held legally accountable for orchestrating the wave of illegal migration and the resulting human rights violations,” Lithuanian Justice Minister Rimantas Mockus said in a statement on Monday.     “We are taking this case to the International Court of Justice to send a clear message: no state can use vulnerable people as political pawns without facing consequences under international law.” The case, submitted to the ICJ in The Hague, centres on alleged violations by Belarus of the United Nations Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. Lithuania’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said attempts to resolve the issue through bilateral talks failed and it has evidence showing direct involvement by the Belarusian state in organising refugee and migrant flows, including a surge in flights from the Middle East operated by Belarusian state-owned airlines. After landing in Belarus, many of the passengers were escorted to the Lithuanian border by Belarusian security forces and forced to cross illegally, Lithuanian officials said. Lithuania also accused Belarus of refusing to cooperate with its border services in preventing irregular crossings and said it is seeking compensation through the ICJ for alleged damages caused, including costs related to border reinforcement. Tensions between the two countries have simmered since 2021 when thousands of people – mostly from the Middle East and Africa – began arriving at the borders of Lithuania, Poland and Latvia from Belarus. Belarus had previously deported Middle Eastern refugees and migrants with more than 400 Iraqis repatriated to Baghdad on a charter flight from Minsk in November 2021. That same year, a Human Rights Watch report accused Belarus of manufacturing the crisis, finding that “accounts of violence, inhuman and degrading treatment and coercion by Belarusian border guards were commonplace”. European Union officials have also accused Minsk of “weaponising” migration in an effort to destabilise the bloc. The claims are strongly denied by Belarus. In December, the EU approved emergency measures allowing member states bordering Belarus and Russia to temporarily suspend asylum rights in cases in which migration is being manipulated for political ends.

"news","Mexican ship hits Brooklyn Bridge: What went wrong, who were the victims?","19 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","Two Mexican cadets are killed when the vessel, named Cuauhtemoc and carrying 277 people, crashes into the New York landmark. Two people have been killed when a Mexican navy training ship struck New York City’s Brooklyn Bridge. According to Mayor Eric Adams, the vessel, named Cuauhtemoc, was carrying 277 people when it crashed on Saturday into the bridge. Of the 20 people injured in the accident, 11 were in critical condition, the Mexican navy said in a statement.     Adams said the 142-year-old bridge was spared major damage. An investigation has been launched into the incident. Here is what we know: The vessel set sail from Acapulco on Mexico’s Pacific coast on April 4, according to a release from the Mexican Secretariat of the Navy. It arrived in New York City on Tuesday and was headed to Iceland as part of a global tour. The mission was designed to “exalt the seafaring spirit, strengthen naval education, and deliver a message of peace and goodwill from the Mexican people to the seas and ports of the world”, the government said. The voyage was scheduled to last 170 days at sea and include 84 days in port with planned stops at 22 ports in 15 countries. The crew had 277 members, 64 women and 213 men. The ship’s itinerary included stops in Jamaica, Cuba, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The journey also was meant to commemorate the 1825 expulsion of the last Spanish stronghold in Mexico by its navy, an event that marked the consolidation of Mexico’s independence and the emergence of a new national era on the sea. Cuauhtemoc was built in Bilbao, Spain, in 1981. It was acquired by the Mexican navy to serve as a vessel dedicated exclusively to the training of captains, officers, cadets, noncommissioned officers and seamen. The vessel is 91 metres (300ft) long, and its main mast stands 50 metres (160ft) tall, about 9 metres (30ft) higher than the distance between the water and the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge. The ship was parked at Pier 17 in Manhattan, right below the Brooklyn Bridge On Saturday night, it was scheduled to depart southwards through New York Harbor, making a brief stop along the Brooklyn waterfront to refuel before continuing its journey to Iceland. However, about 8:20pm (16:20 GMT), the Cuauhtemoc appeared to be travelling in the wrong direction and was never meant to pass under the Brooklyn Bridge. Authorities began responding about 8:26pm after receiving multiple 911 calls, the New York City Police Department said. According to reports, the captain of the Cuauhtemoc told investigators that he lost control of the vessel after the rudder stopped working. “They had some kind of mechanical problem. They lost power, so since they couldn’t use the rudder, they couldn’t manoeuvre,” an official told CNN, cautioning that all information about the accident at this point is preliminary and subject to change. Adams previously said the ship lost power, and other city officials previously indicated that “mechanical issues” may have caused the collision. The ship was also manoeuvring in turbulent waters. The tide had just turned, and a fast current was heading up the East River as a 16-kilometre-per-hour (10-mile-per-hour) wind set in, according to a report by The Associated Press news agency.  Naval cadets dressed in white uniforms could be seen dangling from the ship’s crossbeams after the crash. Three of the ship’s masts were snapped. A female cadet and a male marine died from their injuries, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters on Sunday. According to media reports, the two people killed have been identified as America Yamileth Sanchez, 20, of Xalapa in the eastern state of Veracruz and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos, 22, from Oaxaca in southern Mexico. In a statement shared on Facebook, the local city council of San Mateo del Mar, located in Oaxaca, expressed deep sorrow over Maldonado Marcos’s death and extended “heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones”. Sanchez, who would have turned 21 in June, and Maldonado Marcos had been training on the ship for the past nine months. Sanchez was in the masts when the ship crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge.

"news","Biden’s prostate cancer: What happened, how serious is Gleason score 9?","19 May 2025",NA,"Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, the most common form of cancer in US males. Former United States President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. Biden, 82, was diagnosed on Friday after doctors discovered a nodule on his prostate, his office said in a statement released on Sunday. The statement added that the cancer had “a Gleason score of nine (Grade Group 5)” on a scale that goes up to 10, signifying that Biden’s cancer is highly aggressive. Here is what you need to know about Biden’s diagnosis: Prostate cancer is confirmed through a biopsy, a procedure in which tissue is collected to check for signs of disease. The Gleason score, also known as the Gleason index, is a grading system that assesses how aggressive prostate cancer is by examining the appearance of cancer cells under a microscope. A pathologist examines prostate tissue and assigns two Gleason grades: one for the most common pattern of cancer cells and one for the second most common pattern.    Each grade falls between 1 and 5, where one indicates tissue that closely resembles normal cells and five represents the most abnormal appearance. These two grades are added together to get the Gleason score, which ranges from 2 to 10. A 9 or 10 score is seen as a very aggressive form of cancer. Prostate cancer ranks as the most frequently identified cancer in American men, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the US. Globally, it is the second most common form of cancer among men and fourth most common overall, according to the World Cancer Research Fund. This type of cancer affects the prostate, a small gland located near the male bladder that contributes to the production of semen. Although the exact causes remain unclear, some evidence suggests that a diet high in fat could be a contributing factor. So far in 2025, more than 313,000 new cases of prostate cancer have been diagnosed in the US, the NCI said on its website. That’s nearly three times higher than the second most common type of cancer among American men, lung cancer, at 110,000 new cases. The US has the highest number of recorded cases of prostate cancer in the world. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 13 out of 100 American men will get the disease, citing age as the “most common risk factor”. Symptoms include urinating often, difficulty urinating, a burning sensation while urinating, and blood in the semen or urine, the CDC said. According to the statement from Biden’s office, “the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management”. “The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians,” it added. A hormone-sensitive prostate cancer needs androgens, a group of male sex hormones, to grow – most of which are made in the testicles. The American Cancer Society notes this specific type of prostate cancer can be treated using androgen deprivation therapy, which reduces the level of androgens to “stop them from fuelling prostate cancer cell growth”. Johns Hopkins Medicine said on average the five-year survival rate for prostate cancer is nearly 100 percent after diagnosis but drops to 28 percent if the cancer has metastasised as it has done in Biden’s case. It also notes that the 10-year and 15-year survival rates are 98 percent and 95 percent, respectively. Outcomes have improved in recent decades, and patients can expect to live with metastatic prostate cancer for four or five years, said Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Brigham Cancer Center. “It’s very treatable but not curable,” Smith told The Associated Press news agency. “Most men in this situation would be treated with drugs and would not be advised to have either surgery or radiation therapy.” Longtime foe President Donald Trump, whom Biden defeated in the 2020 election, said in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, that he wished Biden “a fast and successful recovery”. Former President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Biden, who was Obama’s vice president. “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace,” Obama posted on X. Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family. Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery. — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 18, 2025  Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate in 2024 and Biden’s vice president, said she was “saddened” to hear of Biden’s diagnosis. “Joe is a fighter – and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” Harris wrote on social media. Former US Secretary of State and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said she was “thinking of the Bidens as they take on cancer, a disease they’ve done so much to try to spare other families from”. Biden’s oldest son, Beau, died from brain cancer in 2015, aged 46. After Beau’s death, Obama in 2016 launched the Cancer Moonshot Initiative to help speed up cancer research to try to make advances in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the disease. Obama appointed Biden to lead the initiative.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/19/gleason-score-9-how-aggressive-is-bidens-prostrate-cancer"
"news","Iran summons UK charge d’affaires amid nuclear friction","19 May 2025","Maziar Motamedi","‘Suspicious and unwarranted’ arrests of Iranians come amid lingering tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme and the fallout of Russia-Ukraine war. Tehran, Iran – Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the United Kingdom’s charge d’affaires over what it called “suspicious and unwarranted” arrests of several Iranian nationals. The UK earlier this month accused several Iranian nationals of offences without offering evidence, wilfully refrained from informing Iran’s embassy in time, and prevented consular access contrary to international norms, the ministry said in a statement issued late on Sunday, according to state media. It also accused the British government of harbouring “political motivations to exert pressure on Iran” with the arrests. The UK government responded with a terse statement released hours later, which said its Foreign Office has summoned Iran’s ambassador Ali Mousavi “in response to three Iranian nationals charged under the National Security Act”. “The UK government is clear that protecting national security remains our top priority and Iran must be held accountable for its actions.” The diplomatic spat comes two days after British police charged three Iranians with suspected espionage for Iran’s intelligence services under the country’s National Security Act of 2023. Mostafa Sepahvand, 39, Farhad Javadi Manesh, 44, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, 55, were accused of conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service between August 14, 2024 and February 16, 2025. They appeared before a Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Saturday, where they were also charged with engaging in surveillance and reconnaissance with the intention of committing or supporting serious violence against a person in the UK. Their cases were referred to a central criminal court, and the next hearing is scheduled for early June.    The three are among eight individuals arrested in May, including seven Iranians, as part of two separate operations which Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said were some of the biggest investigations of their kind in recent years. The four other Iranians were arrested as part of a “counterterrorism” operation, with investigations ongoing. The eighth man was released without charge last week. In a stated effort towards improving national security against covert foreign influences, the UK has placed Iran on its highest tier under the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS). The arrests come amid strained ties between Iran and three European powers over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The UK, France and Germany have repeatedly criticised Iran for a purported lack of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure that Iran’s nuclear programme remains peaceful. The trio, branded the E3 in the context of the negotiations, were party to Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal, which the United States unilaterally abandoned in 2018. However, the US has reopened talks with Tehran in a bid to secure a new deal, and amid four rounds of talks mediated by Oman, Iran has emphasised it is open to holding more talks with the E3 as well. Senior diplomats from the two sides gathered on Friday in Turkiye’s Istanbul for their first meeting since the nuclear talks with Washington commenced last month. Both sides stressed a commitment to continued diplomacy, but there was no breakthrough. Rather, Iran has repeatedly warned that there will be “serious ramifications” if the E3 push to invoke the “snapback” mechanism of the comatose 2015 nuclear deal, which would reinstate the United Nations Security Council sanctions that were lifted as part of the landmark accord. Tehran and Washington have also failed to see eye to eye so far when it comes to enrichment of uranium, with Iran reiterating on Monday that it will not back down from its right to have a civilian nuclear programme. After US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said President Donald Trump’s administration would not allow Iran to enrich uranium even to 1 percent, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “unrealistic” demands would only lead to a dead end. The E3 is also concerned about numerous reports that Iran has been arming Russia for its war in Ukraine, accusations that Tehran denies. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said Tehran has yet to receive a written proposal from the US to advance to a fifth round of negotiations, which is expected soon. He also said Iran has not proposed a joint enrichment venture with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but backs such an effort. “The West Asia region, and specifically countries of the Persian Gulf, may increasingly require nuclear energy and to build power plants requiring nuclear fuel, so it won’t be bad if nuclear fuel facilities or consortiums are created in our region so everyone can invest in them.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/19/iran-summons-uk-charge-daffaires-amid-nuclear-friction"
"news","Trump-Putin call: Could it lead to a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire?","19 May 2025","Sarah Shamim","The US president says only Putin and he can stitch together a truce. Their call on Monday will test that theory. United States President Donald Trump has said he will speak with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Monday to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine. His announcement came a day after direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, hosted by Turkiye, ended inconclusively. Before Trump’s call with Putin, European leaders spoke to the US president and voiced their hopes that Putin would accept a ceasefire. Trump said he also plans to speak to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after talking to Putin. Here is where talks on a potential ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow stand more than three years after Russia launched a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that he would speak to Putin on a call at 10am (14:00 GMT). “THE SUBJECTS OF THE CALL WILL BE, STOPPING THE ‘BLOODBATH’ THAT IS KILLING, ON AVERAGE, MORE THAN 5000 RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS A WEEK, AND TRADE,” Trump said in the post. He added that, after speaking to Putin, he would also speak to Zelenskyy and various NATO members. “A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!” On Friday, Turkiye hosted direct talks between Russia and Ukraine for the first time since the early days of the war at Istanbul’s Dolmabahce Palace. Proposed by Putin, the talks were originally scheduled for Thursday but were deferred by a day. Before the talks, Zelenskyy had announced that he would personally attend if Putin also joined the meeting. However, on Wednesday, the Kremlin announced that Putin would not attend and instead announced a negotiating team led by a former culture minister who had also headed previous Russian delegations in unsuccessful talks on the war in Ukraine. In response, Zelenskyy, who was in Ankara, where he met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appointed his defence minister to lead the Ukrainian delegation. The talks were ultimately held on Friday but failed to yield any breakthrough on a ceasefire. However, the two sides reached a prisoner exchange deal. Representatives from both sides confirmed that each country had agreed to release 1,000 prisoners of war. The leader of the Russian delegation and adviser to Putin, Vladimir Medinsky, said the swap would take place “in the coming days”. The two teams also discussed a potential meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, whose legitimacy as Ukraine’s leader has frequently been questioned by the Russian president. Zelenskyy said Putin’s empty seat at the negotiating table kept a ceasefire from taking shape because Russia was represented by a low-level delegation of officials who had not been given the power to make decisions. But while the Ukrainian leader was critical of Putin, Trump appeared empathetic. At a news conference in Doha, Qatar, on the second leg of his Middle East trip last week, Trump suggested it was unrealistic to have expected Putin to attend the talks unless the US president attended too. He doubled down on that view hours later. “Nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together,” Trump told reporters on Thursday on an Air Force One flight to the United Arab Emirates, which the US president visited after Qatar. “Everyone could see that the Russian delegation in Istanbul was of a very low level. None of them were people who actually make decisions in Russia. Still, I sent our team,” Zelenskyy wrote in an X post on Friday after the talks in Turkiye concluded. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed to Russian news agencies that Putin would speak with Trump on Monday. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy met US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Rome on Sunday on the margins of Pope Leo XIV’s inaugural Mass. “We discussed negotiations in Istanbul to where the Russians sent a low level delegation of non-decision-makers,” Zelenskyy wrote in another X post. “I reaffirmed that Ukraine is ready to be engaged in real diplomacy and underscored the importance of a full and unconditional ceasefire as soon as possible.” On Friday, after the talks, Zelenskyy wrote on X: “President Trump wants to end this war. We need to keep working closely with him and stay as coordinated as possible.” He also said long-term US support is essential. Ukraine is calling for an unconditional, 30-day ceasefire. Russia, however, has raised concerns that Ukraine might use such a truce to rearm and mobilise more troops. Before Trump’s call with Putin, leaders of the United Kingdom, the US, Italy, France and Germany discussed the war in Ukraine, a spokesperson representing British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said on Monday. French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in an X post that the conversation, which took place on Sunday, was between him, Trump, Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. “Tomorrow, President Putin must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire proposed by President Trump and backed by Ukraine and Europe,” Macron wrote. In an X post, Merz echoed Macron’s sentiments that Putin must accept the ceasefire proposal. “We want to continue this exchange today,” he wrote. In an X post, Meloni said Moscow ought to “seriously engage” through direct contact. “We hear from the Russian side that it’s going to be a very significant call, and the hopes are high in terms of Putin talking directly to Trump to settle the war in Ukraine and to settle some economic issues concerning bilateral relations with the United States,” Marina Miron, a postdoctoral researcher at the Defence Studies Department at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera. On the other hand, Miron said, the Ukrainian side is sceptical, “saying that this is just something for Putin to drag his feet”. She explained that there can be three possible outcomes from the phone call. First, Putin and Trump could agree on some sort of a ceasefire. Second, they could disagree or find middle ground. But Miron postulated that a third option is the most likely outcome: “We have to understand that the Russian side, while it’s ready to talk, it will say we are ready for a ceasefire but here is the list of our conditions.” “I think it is important here to signal that Europe has pretty much no role in this to play. Ukraine has not much of a say either if this is going to be settled between Putin and Trump,” Miron said. Referring to the news of European leaders trying to “influence Trump before the call to advocate for the European position”, Miron said: “I don’t think that’s going to have any impact on Trump’s way of talking to Putin.” “Trump understands that the United States doesn’t have a lot of options here either. Either they cut off all the support to Ukraine and force elections, or they continue supporting Ukraine in order for Ukraine to be able to settle it on the battlefield with the Russians,” Miron said, adding that the second option is very difficult, given other priorities that the Trump administration has. Trump had advocated for scaling back US military aid to Ukraine. On Sunday, Russia launched its largest drone attack since the beginning of the war, Ukraine said, killing at least one woman. The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 273 drones on Sunday morning. Later in the day, Kyiv’s intelligence service claimed that it believed Russia planned to fire an intercontinental ballistic missile to intimidate the West. It was not clear if it actually happened. Moscow has not yet responded to these allegations. Trump had pledged to bring a swift end to the war. And starting in February, representatives from the US had separate meetings with Russian and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. All three sides agreed on temporary deals, maintaining Black Sea safety and halting attacks on energy infrastructure. Russia and Ukraine blamed each other multiple times for reneging on the terms of these deals, which have now expired.

"news","First trickle of aid in 3 months after Israel allows limited food into Gaza","19 May 2025",NA,"Israeli PM Netanyahu says pressure from allies is behind the move to allow some aid in. Israel’s military and the United Nations say five UN trucks carrying humanitarian aid have been allowed into besieged Gaza, the first such delivery in nearly three months. The UN on Monday called it a “welcome development” but “a drop in the ocean” when so much more aid is needed to address the humanitarian crisis. Food security experts last week warned of famine. Israel had kept Gaza under total blockade since March 2, pushing its Palestinian population into acute starvation. It announced it would allow limited supplies of food into Gaza as it launched an intensified ground offensive during an ongoing heavy bombardment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that pressure from allies was behind the move. His office had said Israel would open the way for some food to enter the Gaza Strip after a “recommendation” from the army the previous evening. The announcement came shortly after the Israeli military launched “extensive ground operations” that are reported to have killed more than 150 people within 24 hours. On Monday, Israel carried out at least 30 air strikes within an hour in the Khan Younis area and from dawn killed more than 71 Palestinians across Gaza, medical sources told Al Jazeera. “Israel will allow a basic amount of food for the population to ensure that a hunger crisis does not develop in the Gaza Strip,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement late on Sunday. Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera is banned from Israel, said the “real reason” some aid is being allowed into Gaza is so the Israelis can continue with their military operations. “Make no mistake, the aid that’s going to be entering Gaza is nowhere near enough,” Salhut said. After 11 weeks of total blockade, UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said Israeli authorities cleared nine aid trucks to enter Gaza, where harsh restrictions on food and aid have sparked accusations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war. Fletcher called the entry of the trucks through the Karem Abu Salem crossing (Kerem Shalom in Hebrew) a “welcome development” but said aid must be allowed into the Strip on a massive scale to deliver relief for Palestinians. “It is a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed, and significantly more aid must be allowed into Gaza starting tomorrow morning,” Fletcher said in a statement. In the meantime, the leaders of Britain, France and Canada warned their countries would take action, including possible sanctions, if Israel does not halt its renewed military offensive in Gaza and lift aid restrictions. “The Israeli Government’s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,” a joint statement released by the British government said. “We oppose any attempt to expand settlements in the West Bank … We will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions”, it added. Twenty-two donor countries also issued a joint statement Monday urging Israel to “allow a full resumption of aid into Gaza immediately”. The Foreign Ministers of the countries said that “whilst we acknowledge indications of a limited restart of aid”, the population of the war-ravaged territory “faces starvation” and “must receive the aid they desperately need”. The statement was signed by the top diplomats of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.    Israel’s block on aid has driven up the risk of famine, warned Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization (WHO). He said the WHO and other UN agencies stood ready to deliver aid into Gaza – if and when it is allowed to enter. “Two months into the latest blockade, two million people are starving,” the WHO chief said, speaking at the opening of the annual World Health Assembly, adding that 160,000 tonnes of food are “blocked at the border just minutes away”. “People are dying from preventable diseases as medicines wait at the border, while attacks on hospitals deny people care and deter them from seeking it,” he added. Munir al-Bursh, the director general of Gaza’s Ministry of Health, had said Palestinian authorities had not been informed when the border would be opened, Al Jazeera Arabic reported. International pressure has been building on Israel to lift the siege, which still threatens widespread famine in the besieged territory. Netanyahu said in a video address on Monday that “allies” had voiced concern about “images of hunger”. Israel’s “greatest friends in the world”, he said without mentioning specific countries, had said there is “one thing we cannot stand. We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We cannot stand that. We will not be able to support you.” “Therefore, to achieve victory, we need to somehow solve the problem,” Netanyahu said. The aid let into Gaza would be “minimal”, he said.    Netanyahu’s far-right allies remain opposed to allowing any supplies into Gaza, insisting that military might and hunger will secure victory over Hamas. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir described the decision to allow limited food into the enclave as a “grave mistake”. Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu, a member of Ben-Gvir’s party, denounced the plan as a “tragedy”, saying it directly harms the “war effort to achieve victory” in Gaza. Israel has been accused of weaponising hunger and using the blockade to try to ethnically cleanse the enclave. As it intensified its military offensive, sources on both sides told the Reuters news agency there has been no progress in a new round of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Doha, Qatar. Netanyahu said the talks included discussions on a truce and a deal on the captives as well as a proposal to end the war in return for the exile of Hamas and the demilitarisation of Gaza – terms Hamas has previously rejected. The Israeli military suggested in a later statement that it could still scale down operations to help reach a deal in Doha. However, Netanyahu stressed in his video address that the aim of the intensified offensive is for Israel’s forces to “take control of all” of Gaza. “The fighting is intense, and we are making progress. We will take control of all the territory of the Strip,” he said. “We will not give up. But in order to succeed, we must act in a way that cannot be stopped.” Over the past week, Israel’s military said it had conducted a preliminary wave of strikes on more than 670 Hamas targets in Gaza. It said it killed dozens of Hamas fighters. Gaza’s Health Ministry said in the week to Sunday, at least 464 Palestinians were killed, many of them women and children. There have also been reports of Israeli attacks in and around the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis and the targeting of the intensive care unit at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, where at least 55 people are trapped, including four doctors and eight nurses.

"news","US PGA Championship 2025: Scottie Scheffler wins third major title","19 May 2025",NA,"World number one Scottie Scheffler outlasts a final round challenge from Jon Rahm to record a five-stroke victory in golf’s second major of the year. Scottie Scheffler held off a spirited effort by Spain’s Jon Rahm to secure a five-shot PGA Championship victory at Quail Hollow Club for his third career major title. The top-ranked Scheffler, who was three shots clear of Swede Alex Noren at the start of the day, struggled off the tee early on Sunday but righted the ship in time for the back nine to card an even-par 71 that left him at 11 under for the week. “I knew it was going to be a challenging day, finishing off a major championship is always challenging,” Scheffler said on the 18th green after being presented with the Wanamaker Trophy. “I didn’t have my best stuff … but stepped it up on the back nine.” Ryder Cup hopeful Harris English, who began his day 11 shots adrift, shot a 65 that was the low round of the day and finished in a distant share of second place alongside fellow Americans Bryson DeChambeau (70) and Davis Riley (72). Twice major champion Rahm (73) gave Scheffler a scare early on the back nine but came apart in stunning fashion with five dropped shots over his final three holes to slide back into a share of eighth place. Rahm, who began the day five shots back of the lead and playing two groups ahead of Scheffler, took a while to get going in the final round but found his groove right in time to set up some back-nine drama at Quail Hollow Club. The Spaniard joined Scheffler atop the leaderboard when, at the par-four 11th, he made his third birdie over a four-hole stretch, but Scheffler reclaimed the outright lead with a 9-foot birdie at the 10th moments later. Rahm nearly answered right back, but his perfectly paced 19-foot birdie attempt at the par-three 13th curled around and out of the cup before going on to misread birdie putts at the next two holes, followed by his brutal closing stretch. Scheffler added birdies at 14 and 15 and then saw his lead suddenly grow to five over JT Poston after Rahm made double-bogey at the par-three 17th, where he blasted his tee shot into the water. “It’s a tough pill to swallow right now,” said Rahm. “Pretty fresh wound right now. But there’s been a lot of good happening this week and a lot of positive feelings to take for the rest of the year.” US Open champion DeChambeau, who finished runner-up at last year’s PGA Championship, was driving the ball and giving himself chances, but struggled on the greens. “I felt like I had the game to win this week, and the golf course suited me pretty well, missed a few putts coming down the stretch and got a little unlucky in this great game of golf,” said DeChambeau. “It was a good fight, good battle, take a lot from it. It’s just burning a bigger fire in my belly.” Noren, playing alongside Scheffler and alone in second place to start the day, stayed in the mix until his round unravelled with a trio of bogeys early on the back nine. Scheffler took home a $3.42m top prize from a record $19m purse.

"news","China’s industrial output, retail sales dip amid US trade tensions","19 May 2025",NA,"Despite slowdown, data points to reliance of Chinese economy in the face of Donald Trump’s tariffs. China’s industrial output and retail sales growth have slowed amid trade tensions with the United States. Factory output grew 6.1 percent year-on-year in April, down from a 7.7 percent rise in March, data released by China’s National Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday. While down compared with the previous month, the figure beat analysts’ expectations. Analysts polled by the Reuters and Bloomberg news agencies had respectively forecast growth of 5.5 percent and 5.7 percent. Retail sales grew 5.1 percent year-on-year, slower than the 5.9 percent growth recorded in March and below analysts’ forecasts. Fixed-asset investment, which includes property and infrastructure investment, rose 4 percent. Unemployment fell slightly, from 5.2 percent to 5.1 percent. The latest data is likely to bolster hopes of China’s economy remaining resilient in the face of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, after gross domestic product expanded a better-than-expected 5.4 percent in the January-March period. The National Bureau of Statistics said the economy maintained “new and positive development momentum” due to Beijing’s economic policies, despite the “increasing impact of external shocks”. “However, we should be aware that there are still many unstable and uncertain factors in external environment, and the foundation for sustained economic recovery needs to be further consolidated,” the statistics agency said in a statement. The economic figures are the first to be released since Washington and Beijing last week agreed to dramatically reduce tariffs on each other’s goods for 90 days. Under the deal reached in Geneva, the US lowered its tariff on Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China slashed its rate from 125 percent to 10 percent. “The risk is that tariffs remain in place for a long time, and eventually, we see production offshored,” Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said in a note on Monday. “But amid tariff unpredictability, not just for China but across the world, few companies will be rushing to commit resources to set up offshore manufacturing facilities. This could mean that a decent portion of China’s manufacturing and exports will be less impacted than originally feared.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/5/19/chinas-industrial-output-retail-sales-dip-amid-us-trade-tensions"
"news","Thunder vs Nuggets: OKC win Game 7, reach Western Conference finals","19 May 2025",NA,"Oklahoma City Thunder dominate Game 7 playoff decider against Denver Nuggets to set up a Western Conference finals clash against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 35 points to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 125-93 home win over the Denver Nuggets in Game 7 of their Western Conference second-round NBA playoff series. The Thunder advanced to the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2016. They open the conference finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves at home on Tuesday. After scoring just six points in Thursday’s loss, Thunder All-Star Jalen Williams bounced back in a big way, pouring in 24 points on 10-of-17 shooting in Sunday’s Game 7. Gilgeous-Alexander was 12 of 19 from the floor with three steals and no turnovers. “He [Williams] was amazing,” said Gilgeous-Alexander. “He wouldn’t have played the way he played today last year, I know that 100 percent. To see him take that step forward is a really proud moment.” Early on, it looked like the Nuggets were carrying over the momentum from their Game 6 win. They led by double digits with a minute left in the first quarter before the Thunder ripped off a 13-0 run spanning the first and second quarters to take the lead for the first time. The Thunder grabbed the lead for good on Luguentz Dort’s 3-pointer with 7 minutes 20 seconds left in the first half. They closed the first half on an 18-5 run, including back-to-back Nuggets turnovers that led to Williams’s buckets at the other end and helped the Thunder build a 60-46 lead at half time. Then the Thunder put the game on ice with a 37-point third quarter, with 10 of those coming off the Nuggets’ five turnovers. The Thunder led by as many as 43 points in the fourth quarter. The Nuggets were also 3 of 14 from beyond the arc in the third quarter and finished the game just 10 of 45 on 3-pointers. “To have the start we wanted and then to have it go sideways so quickly [was tough],” said Nuggets’ interim coach David Adelman. “I thought we controlled the pace of the game early, it’s easy to forget that now … Once they got back into it, they kept bringing new people in and it did overwhelm us.” A big part of the Thunder’s success was thanks to Alex Caruso’s defence. Despite a considerable deficit, Caruso spent plenty of time on Nuggets star Nikola Jokic, who often found it difficult to find shots against Oklahoma City’s top-ranked defence. Jokic scored 20 points on 5-of-9 shooting, while Caruso finished with a game-best plus-40 plus/minus rating. “The volume of it today was a result of how effective it was, but looking at it was a priority going into today,” said Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault regarding Caruso’s efforts. “He did an unbelievable job individually.” The Thunder scored 37 points off Denver’s 23 turnovers, while giving the ball up just 10 times themselves. Nuggets forward Aaron Gordon, who suffered a hamstring injury late in Game 6 and was a game-time decision, played more than 24 minutes, finishing with eight points and 11 rebounds. “It means a lot, specifically for the city,” said Gilgeous-Alexander on advancing to the conference finals. “They’ve been so good all year. They’ve been behind us, through good, through bad. No team in the league has a home-court advantage like we do.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/19/thunder-vs-nuggets-okc-win-game-7-reach-western-conference-finals"

"news","Lionel Messi, Inter Miami lose to Orlando City in MLS","19 May 2025",NA,"Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami had one of their worst performances of the season, losing at home to their Florida rivals. Lionel Messi’s frustration grew as Inter Miami’s miserable run continued with a 3-0 loss at home to Orlando City in Major League Soccer (MLS). The Florida derby defeat on Sunday leaves Miami with one win from their last seven games in all competitions. They have slipped to sixth in the Eastern Conference, with Orlando leapfrogging them. Messi had just two shots on target and scuffed a free-kick as his form slumped with that of his team. “Now, we’ll truly see if we’re a team in difficult times, because when everything’s going well, it’s very easy,” Messi told Apple TV. “When difficult times come, that’s when we have to be more united than ever, be a true team, and pull ourselves together,” he added. Messi questioned the refereeing, but in truth, the loss had little to do with officiating and much to do with shambolic defending, a disjointed midfield and a punchless attack led by the rapidly fading Luis Suarez. Orlando grabbed the lead in the 43rd minute with a goal of absurd simplicity. Goalkeeper Pedro Gallese launched the ball downfield, and Luis Muriel ran clear and slotted past Oscar Ustari. The visitors were getting plenty of joy from going direct against a Miami backline, which was all at sea. Argentinian Martin Ojeda should have done better when he found himself clear on goal, but blasted over. Miami’s veteran keeper Ustari made a fine double save, but then the 38-year-old found himself to blame for Orlando’s second goal. The ball fell to Marco Pasalic on the edge of the box, and his low shot went through the hands and legs of Ustari to double the Orlando lead. Miami coach Javier Mascherano threw on attacking players in a bid to retrieve something from the game, but it was in vain. In the fourth minute of stoppage time, Duncan McGuire broke down the left, and his low cross was slotted home by Icelandic forward Dagur Thorhallsson to wrap up an impressive performance from the visitors. Miami have conceded 20 goals in their last seven games, with their only victory coming against the New York Red Bulls on May 3. Mascherano said the first goal changed the game. “I’d say for 25 or 30 minutes, we had it completely under control playing in the opponent’s half, but this is how it is, clearly. I’m not going to deny what the result is,” he said. Miami’s MLS campaign was going well until their exit in the Concacaf Champions Cup at the hands of the Vancouver Whitecaps. Mascherano admitted the team’s morale had been hit. “Clearly, something has happened where the team has lost a lot of confidence. We have had a drop in level, individually and collectively, and it’s clear one way or another – we have tried with different schemes, different names, and still today, we are hurting. We will keep trying to find a way.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/19/lionel-messi-inter-miami-lose-to-orlando-city-in-mls"
"news","Measure targeting pro-Palestine NGOs disappears from US tax bill","19 May 2025","Ali Harb","Legislation would have allowed the executive branch to crack down on ‘terrorism supporting’ nonprofits. Washington, DC – A measure known as the “nonprofit killer” has been removed from an enormous tax bill being advanced in the United States Congress, according to the bill posted online by the House of Representatives. The provision, which no longer appeared on the President Donald Trump-backed “One Big, Beautiful Bill” on Monday, would have given the executive branch the authority to strip the tax-exempt status of nonprofits that it deems supportive of “terrorism”. Advocates have warned that the legislative effort – which failed to pass as a stand-alone bill last year – could be abused to crack down on groups that the administration does not agree with, particularly nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) that support Palestinian rights. Israel has given little indication that it is relenting after more than 19 months into its war on Gaza. The past week has seen an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, which has killed hundreds of people. The reason for the disappearance of the NGO provision remains unclear, and experts warned it may yet reappear in the bill before the final vote in the House, expected later in the week. The office of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. With a razor-thin majority in the House, Republicans need every vote to pass the tax bill, which Trump has put at the top of his agenda in Congress. Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the section may have been removed to avoid putting the must-pass bill at risk, especially because the House parliamentarian, a nonpartisan office that oversees procedures, may have rejected it for violating the rules. “It’s possible that this is a hiccup that they didn’t want, given that it wasn’t even likely to go through,” Hamadanchy told Al Jazeera. “I can’t tell you that is the reason for sure. What I can tell you is that we continue to be very vigilant in case it comes back, either later this week or in the future.”    For weeks, Trump has been calling on Congress to pass the bill, which extends his 2017 tax cuts, a key component of his economic plans. But the proposal has faced some opposition from conservative budget hawks, who have argued it does not cut spending enough and would add to the nation’s $36.2 trillion debt. So Republicans can ill-afford unnecessary issues that could derail the passage of the legislation. Rights groups have been rallying against the “nonprofit killer”, saying it violates free speech and the right to due process. The proposal would have granted the secretary of state power to unilaterally declare an NGO “terrorist supporting” and make it ineligible for tax exemptions. It also said the government would not have to reveal the reason behind the designation if “disclosure of such description would be inconsistent with national security or law enforcement interests”. Under the current rules, organisations certified to be nonprofits by the government get breaks on their federal income taxes. The status also makes donations to such groups tax deductible for donors. While the withdrawn measure would have allowed a targeted NGO to challenge the secretary of state’s decision in court, losing the tax exempt status, even if temporarily, could have proven costly for nonprofits, especially smaller organisations. Hamadanchy said being accused of supporting terrorism could also have prompted banks to close down the accounts of the groups. “And then you have legal costs fighting off the designation because even if you might win in court, it’s going to take time to get there, and it’s going to cause a lot of damage to your organisation through that process,” he said. “And that’s sort of the point because they want to chill speech.” Hamadanchy noted that existing laws already make material support for a designated “terrorist” group a criminal offence with severe penalties.    The legislative push coincided with the Trump administration’s crackdown on Palestinian rights supporters, especially on college campuses. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the student visas of several Palestine advocates – who have not been charged with a criminal offence – over allegations of “support for terrorism”. Some advocacy groups have portrayed the “nonprofit killer” as part of a broader push to muzzle voices critical of Israel. “This bill is designed to silence dissent, especially from Muslim, Palestinian and civil rights organizations that speak out against injustice and genocide,” the Council on American Islamic Relations said in a statement last week. “It threatens every nonprofit that engages in advocacy, educates the public, or challenges government policy.” The apparent setback for the nonprofit provision came nearly two weeks after House leaders cancelled a vote on a bill to restrict boycotts of Israel after a backlash from right-wing legislators who voiced opposition to the measure on free speech grounds. Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, said it would be “interesting” to see how Republican leaders would deal with staunchly pro-Israel measures like the “nonprofit killer” going forward. “They on the one hand likely see this as a fun opportunity to embarrass Democrats – whose opposition will be framed as anti-Israel or enabling terror and antisemitism – and on the other hand they have to worry about principled opposition from within their own ranks,” Friedman told Al Jazeera in a statement.

"features","What is Israel’s new major ground offensive, Operation Gideon’s Chariots?","19 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","Israeli military launches a ground offensive in the besieged Gaza Strip as ceasefire talks are held in Doha. Israel’s military has launched an intense ground offensive in the besieged Gaza Strip. The offensive comes on the back of a more than two-month total blockade on Gaza after Israel decided to unilaterally end a ceasefire with Hamas in March. Israel has come under increasing international pressure, including from its staunch allies in the United States government, to agree to a ceasefire and allow aid into Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas and Israeli negotiators are in Doha for new indirect talks. Here’s everything you need to know about Israel’s latest ground assault:    Operation Gideon’s Chariots is a major ground offensive launched by Israel on the Gaza Strip that comes after air attacks killed hundreds of Palestinians in recent days and further debilitated Gaza’s healthcare network. With the backing of Israel’s lethal air force, the operation is targeting both southern and northern Gaza. The assault began as the second day of ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas ended on Saturday in Doha. Israel tends to intensify operations and attacks during such negotiations. It said this latest offensive is exerting “tremendous pressure” on Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched this latest assault as US President Donald Trump concluded his Middle East tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but did not stop in Israel. The Israeli military said the offensive was launched to expand “operational control” in the Gaza Strip. Israel says its campaign also aims to free the remaining captives held in Gaza and defeat Hamas. However, Netanyahu has been repeatedly criticised by segments of Israeli society, including captives’ families, for failing to prioritise their return and has also rejected Hamas’s offers to end the war and free the captives. A week before the start of the operation, quotes were leaked of Netanyahu speaking about the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza outside the Gaza Strip. “We are destroying more and more homes. They have nowhere to return to,” Netanyahu said in closed-door testimony made to the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee. “The only inevitable outcome will be the desire of Gazans to emigrate outside of the Gaza Strip.”    Since Sunday, the day Israel confirmed the operation, at least 144 people have been killed in a relentless wave of strikes. At least 42 people died in the heavily bombarded northern part of the Strip, according to medical sources. Five of those killed were journalists. In southern Gaza, at least 36 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in Israeli air strikes on a tent encampment of displaced Palestinians in the al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis governorate, according to medical sources. But the lead-up to the operation also included heavy attacks. In the past week, Israel has attacked more than 670 places in Gaza and claimed all were “Hamas targets” located both above and beneath the ground. Israel has been accused of disproportionately targeting civilians in Gaza, including displaced families. At least 370 Palestinians were killed over five days. Since the start of the war in October 2023, at least 53,339 Palestinians have been killed and 121,034 wounded, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. The severity of the recent attacks has many Palestinians expressing fears on social media that their latest posts may be their last. On Monday, the Israeli military issued forced evacuation orders for Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, warning of an “unprecedented attack”.  Israel said it is targeting Hamas targets, a claim that has been increasingly challenged by human rights groups and experts as its more than 19-month war on Gaza continues. Among the sites hit are hospitals, a recurring target for the Israeli military in Gaza. Muhammad Zaqout, the director general of hospitals in Gaza, described the tactic as part of “Israel’s systematic measures against hospitals”. On Sunday, the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza was rendered nonoperational after it was besieged by Israeli forces. Medical professionals said it could lead to the deaths of thousands of sick and wounded people. The situation was described as “catastrophic” by Marwan al-Sultan, the director of the facility, who also called on international organisations to push for the safety of medical teams. Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza’s Jabalia and European Gaza Hospital in southern Gaza have also been bombed. In recent days, Israel said it has killed Hamas’s leader in the Gaza Strip, Mohammad Sinwar, the brother and successor of the late Yahya Sinwar. It also reportedly killed another Sinwar brother, Zakaria Sinwar, a university lecturer, and three of his children in an air strike on central Gaza. On Sunday, Hamas released a statement calling the attacks on displaced Palestinians in Khan Younis a “brutal crime” and a flagrant violation of international laws and norms. The group also placed blame on the US for backing Israel. “By granting the terrorist occupation government political and military cover, the United States administration bears direct responsibility for this insane escalation in the targeting of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip, including children, women, and the elderly,” Hamas said. The entire Strip is at risk of famine. Basic humanitarian supplies, including food, fuel, medical aid and vaccines for children, have been blocked by Israel from entering the Strip. More than 90 percent of the population has been displaced since the war began on October 7, 2023. Many Palestinians have been displaced multiple times with some people being forced to relocate 10 times or more. Israel has refused the entry of any aid since March 2. International actors and agencies have been pressing hard for Israel to resume the distribution of aid to Gaza to little effect. “Two months into the latest blockade, two million people are starving, while 116,000 tonnes of food is blocked at the border just minutes away,” said World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus speaking at the opening of the annual World Health Assembly. One in five Palestinians in Gaza is currently facing starvation, while 9,000 children, who are most vulnerable to Israel’s continued food blockade, have been hospitalised for acute malnutrition since the start of the year, according to the United Nations. Late on Sunday, Netanyahu announced that some food would be allowed into the Gaza Strip in a much needed reprieve for the local population. “Israel will allow a basic amount of food for the population to ensure that a hunger crisis does not develop in the Gaza Strip,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. Netanyahu said on Monday that the move was motivated by pressure from Israel’s allies. It is unclear when the border will open to allow in aid. The latest round of talks started on Saturday, and by the end of Sunday, there had been little progress. Talks are set to continue this week. Israel and Hamas both claimed the talks began without conditions. “The Hamas delegation outlined the position of the group and the necessity to end the war, swap prisoners, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and allow humanitarian aid and all the needs of the people of Gaza back into the Strip,” Taher al-Nono, the media adviser for Hamas’s leadership, told the Reuters news agency.    The criticism of Israel is increasing. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “alarmed” by Israel’s expanded offensive in Gaza and called for an immediate ceasefire. Germany, one of Israel’s foremost backers, expressed deep concern over the offensive. Its Federal Foreign Office said in a statement: “A large-scale military offensive also entails the risk that the catastrophic humanitarian situation for the population in Gaza and the situation of the remaining hostages will continue to deteriorate and that the prospect of an urgently needed long-term ceasefire fades.” After the offensive was confirmed, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called for the “immediate, massive and unhampered” resumption of aid into Gaza. Even before the offensive, international pressure on Israel was growing. Seven European nations urged Israel on Friday to “reverse its current policy” on Gaza. The leaders of Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia, Spain and Norway released a joint statement on what they called a “man-made humanitarian catastrophe that is taking place before our eyes in Gaza”. Tom Fletcher, the UN’s humanitarian chief, has called for decisive action to prevent genocide in Gaza. He criticised the US-Israeli joint plan to replace international aid mechanisms in Gaza as a “waste of time”. More than 160,000 pallets of aid are “ready to move” at the border, he said, but are being blocked by Israel. Volker Turk, the UN’s human rights chief, said on Friday that Israel’s bombing campaign is intended to bring about a “permanent demographic shift in Gaza” and is in “defiance of international law”.

"features","To love a child who joined ISIS","19 May 2025","Nils Adler","A story of a father bearing the weight of his son's decision—grieving in silence, plagued by guilt, fighting to free his grandchildren from detention. Stockholm, Sweden and Northeast Syria - In late September 2014, Aaden*, a sociable, middle-aged father of five, got a call from two intelligence agents asking to meet with him. The two casually-dressed women from the Swedish Security Service (Sapo) were polite and reassuring. They were responding to a panicked call Aaden had made to emergency services about a week earlier. He had phoned for help after his son Damaal* called him from southern Turkiye to say he was about to cross the border into Syria to join ISIL, also known as ISIS. ""But you’ll die!"" Aaden had pleaded with his son. ""Maybe. But I’m strong, thanks to you,"" came the response. Frustrated, Aaden asked the Sapo agents to help him understand how Damaal was ""radicalised"". They told him they were as surprised as he was. Damaal, unlike many other ISIL recruits, had never been flagged in their system. Urging Aaden to contact them if he heard from Damaal, they said goodbye. It would not be long before they spoke again.  It was Christmas Eve last year when the Somali Swedish mechanical engineer, now in his mid-60s, first invited Al Jazeera into the family’s spacious apartment overlooking an expanse of snow-covered forest. He prepared an elaborate selection of cakes and desserts, cups of Turkish tea and very strong coffee. Exuding a nervous energy, he fidgeted with the sofa cushions as he rushed to and from the kitchen to grab a sugar bowl, even though it was not needed. Finally sitting down, he started talking about the flood of conflicting emotions that engulfed him still, even 10 years later. He was intensely angry at his son for joining ISIL and traumatising the family. He was also a father who loved his son unconditionally. Eyes drifting to the large window looking out onto the forest, he relived that September day, the urge to reach into the phone and take his son in his arms, just as he had three days earlier when they last had dinner together. For Aaden, ISIL represents everything he hates after similar armed groups, like al-Shabab, ruined much of his beloved homeland. After Somalia's 1991 civil war, his prestigious job with the United Nations no longer existed. He managed to move to Sweden, where it took two years of bureaucratic wrangling to get his wife and two children to join him. Taking any job he could find, even working as a cleaner, he supported them while studying every evening to master Swedish and earn his mechanical engineering degree. The family soon expanded, with three more babies, and Aaden secured a well-paid job. After years of struggle, Aaden had a stable home and financial security, and looked forward to a peaceful family life. Picking up a photo album from the coffee table, he absently patted the photo of a graduating Damaal on the cover as he looked around. He lives alone, having separated from his wife almost 20 years ago. The two remain such good friends, and are so often at each other's homes, that Aaden says many people assume they are still married. Going from anger to despair, Aaden described talking to Damaal several times in the two days after that first call from Turkiye. He tried desperately to persuade Damaal to come home, but his son was determined, repeating that he was going to help children injured by Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. In the midst of Aaden’s despair, Sapo kept calling to ask if he had any updates. Wanting to do the right thing and believing that the agents had his family’s best interests at heart, Aaden would always oblige, patiently answering their string of follow-up questions. By late 2014, Aaden had his own Sapo handlers who would visit him at work for ""fikas"" - a Swedish coffee break with cinnamon buns and small talk - in his office canteen. He is still cautious when discussing the details of the calls and visits, but said he grew fond of his Sapo contacts. Eventually, he was assigned a single handler, a well-spoken man in his 60s who would calm him down gently when Aaden became stressed or began fretting over who could have convinced his son to join ISIL. They became close. He felt understood.  Damaal was a ""scrawny"" kid - a picky eater with a gentle disposition who always tried to resolve family arguments. He was a good kid, Aaden said, patting the album on his lap. He never had to tell Damaal off, and, other than nagging the boy to eat better, he never had to worry about him getting into trouble or messing up at school. If I die, make sure to look after my children, Dad Damaal grew up football-mad - a staunch Liverpool supporter. He would pick up injured animals to nurse back to health and developed an interest in birds, begging his father to visit his favourite look-out spot and studiously learning their names from a birdwatcher's handbook Aaden bought him. Remaining a very slim teenager, Damaal was rejected from compulsory military service when he graduated from high school. But he started working out when he went to university, Aaden said, and began to bulk up. Aaden opened the photo album and pointed to photos of Damaal at graduation. A smiling 18-year-old beamed up from the pages, with a perfectly groomed moustache and a sharp suit. He is smiling, hugging friends and teachers, and spraying champagne. In his hand is a baby photo of himself that a relative printed onto a placard. The photos were taken just 18 months before Damaal called his dad from Turkiye. He spent those months focusing on his medical studies at the university, living in a modest student apartment nearby that Aaden helped pay for. But he came home regularly to eat his favourite homemade Somali meals and spend time with his family, who often gathered in Aaden’s apartment. It is not clear how Damaal was recruited, but Aaden insisted that he was brainwashed, lured by ISIL recruiters who wanted Damaal’s medical skills and took advantage of the fact that he always wanted to heal the injured. Damaal spoke calmly during those phone calls in September 2014. Most of the time, he seemed sure of his decision, but there were a few moments that had given Aaden hope - moments when Damaal seemed to hesitate. Then, for a while, the calls abruptly stopped. In January 2015, a still-calm Damaal called home and told his dad he was in northern Iraq, working in an ISIL-controlled hospital. He kept calling, whenever he could, and updating his father about his life. There were two marriages, the first a marriage of convenience to ""protect"" a woman he met in Syria from being ""married off"" to a fighter she did not want to wed. By the time of the siege of Raqqa, she had smuggled herself out, unknowingly pregnant with a child she delivered months later. Although she maintains good relations with Damaal’s family, she told Al Jazeera she prefers not to talk about her time in Syria. Damaal then lived with his other wife, Aamiina. The couple eventually had three children. By 2016, they were living in the Syrian city of Raqqa just as the United States-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) began to seize large chunks of territory from ISIL in a series of bloody battles. Aaden implored his son to leave as Raqqa came under siege from the ground and the air in 2017. ""It’s too late for that,"" Damaal said. ""If I die, make sure to look after my children, Dad,"" he said anxiously during a particularly violent bombardment.  As the SDF closed in on Raqqa, Aaden's new handler - a polite and eager younger agent who had replaced his now-retired previous handler - called more frequently. Just before Raqqa was seized by the SDF in 2017, Damaal and his family managed to flee to Baghouz, five hours along the road east, towards Iraq. There, in ISIL's last stronghold, Aamiina gave birth to their third child, Damaal relayed in worried tones over the phone. His friends were dying, he told Aaden in early 2019. If I could survive the siege of Raqqa, I can survive anything There was a band of Swedes who spent most of their time together. One of them, well-known ISIL recruiter Michael Skramo, had been shot in the neck as he was digging a ditch to shelter him and his seven children from air strikes. The bullet went through Skramo's neck and out of his upper back, leaving him paralysed - details that were later confirmed to Al Jazeera by another witness. Damaal tried to nurse the badly injured man. He told his father that Skramo would strain to whisper ""v"", which the Swedes eventually realised was him trying to say ""vatten"", Swedish for water. Skramo, who had been his best friend, died two days later in Damaal’s arms. On the phone, Damaal told his dad: ""I see people dying, houses crumbling, but I’m standing here on the street, and I’m not even injured."" ""Do you have death anxiety?"" he asked his son. ""Yes, but if I could survive the siege of Raqqa, I can survive anything,"" Damaal replied. Then, the phone calls stopped again. Sapo’s calls had reached a crescendo in early 2019 as ISIL collapsed, losing all its territory. After the collapse, Sapo fell silent too. Damaal, his wife and their children had been arrested, but the family found out only when they spotted Damaal being lined up by SDF fighters in the background of a news report in March 2019. Aaden desperately called his contacts at Sapo, but no one picked up or called him back.  Aaden needed to find his son. So began his desperate battle with Swedish authorities to find out what had happened to Damaal, his wife and children. He called every relevant government department, demanding, then pleading, that someone tell him if his son was alive, where he was, and where his family was. But he ran up against one brick wall after another - Sapo had gone silent, as had the Foreign Ministry, which only sent sporadic, generic email responses saying it could not help. He also sought the help of Repatriate the Children Sweden (RTC), a rights organisation founded in 2020 that aims to raise awareness about the children detained in northeast Syria. It was 2021 before he got proof of life, a short note from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) that said his son was ""safe and well"". Aaden had clung to those words for three years, he told Al Jazeera. But it was not enough. He needed to know how his son was doing. After several conversations, Aaden agreed to facilitate a visit to Aamiina and the three children in Syria’s Roj detention camp, where they were being held. But he also wanted someone to visit his son in prison to check on him.  Aamina spends her days confined, and managing her children’s confinement. The 30-something-year-old feels lucky to have made friends in the Roj detention camp, a group of Somali-British detainees who taught her English and help her look after her children, a favour she reciprocates. Their living arrangement is a bit better than others, too, thanks to the money her extended family sends her. She used $150 to buy an additional tent, setting the two up to create a small inner courtyard where her seven-year-old son can run around and expend some of his boundless energy. They also have a television, on which the children watch nature documentaries - a ""window to the outside world"" for children who have known nothing but detention camps their entire lives. Whenever they see a new animal or landscape, the children are full of wonder and questions, and her eldest, a nine-year-old girl, picks up her colours to draw dramatic and abstract interpretations of the world outside the camp. Aamiina is their constant companion, even homeschooling them with books she borrows from the camp's educational facility. She had liked school as a kid, especially history class, and it makes her sad that her children do not feel safe going to the camp school because the teachers scream at them, and the other kids always want to fight. Trying to create a sense of normalcy, she makes dinner every night as her son watches cartoons after his lessons. Using whatever she has available, she experiments with recipes, a passion she developed in the camp. She manages to rustle up quite a few dishes in her rudimentary cooking space, sometimes making her favourite, lasagne, or the children's favourite, pancakes. When she is feeling homesick, she will make Swedish meatballs. As smells waft out from her cooking space, she can usually count on one or both of their cats to come and investigate. An animal lover all her life, Aamiina had adopted the two cats in the camp, taking care of them, playing with them, and keeping them around her and the children, who love them dearly. Overall, things in Roj are marginally better than they were in the al-Hol detention camp, a three-hour drive to the south, where she and the children spent the first year and a half of their captivity. But in early 2025, the guards in Roj seemed to get jumpy, raiding more tents and, she heard, even shooting a woman in the hand for trying to smuggle herself out. One night in February, it was taking her longer than usual to get her two daughters and son to bed. They had heard a visitor was coming to see them the next day, and were excited to meet someone from outside the camp. Then, camp security raided their tent, frightening the children, who took even longer to fall asleep. The next morning, when guards arrived to take them to meet Al Jazeera in the administration office, they felt scared and decided to stay with their neighbours instead. Aamiina pulled on a face mask and headed out with the guards into the damp, windy day. The tension in the sparsely furnished administration office was palpable. Aamiina, softly spoken and slightly built, fidgeted with her mask as she introduced herself in English, exchanging glances with a stone-faced female guard. She had forgotten all her Swedish in the more than 10 years she spent in Syria, she said. Still nervous, she started talking about herself, sharing a brief account of how she travelled from Somalia to Sweden as an unaccompanied minor when she was 11 and was granted permanent residency shortly after. She spent seven years in her adopted homeland before travelling to ISIL-controlled territory in 2014, when she was 20, a decision she said she would not speak about. Aamiina said she has done her best with the children, but is mindful that their chances of integrating into a society outside the camp diminish rapidly as they grow older. She believes they must leave the camp soon if they are to stand a chance of living a normal life. ""It's sad because I came from Sweden. I don't even have Somali citizenship. [The children] are Swedish... and they are supposed to be there,"" she said. Then, with the guard distracted for a minute, Aamiina suddenly began speaking urgently in fluent Swedish. ""They [the guards] play nice now, but that’s not how they are with us,"" she said. ""My son can’t go to the camp fence because he says they’ll shoot him."" Roj, where 2,600 women and children are held, is a smaller and marginally cleaner version of the al-Hol camp, which holds about 40,000 people displaced by ISIL or related to ISIL fighters. But it has poor sanitation and lacks access to health services, Aamiina said, adding that her eldest daughter has been chronically fatigued and underweight for years. The charity Save the Children paid for medical tests at a nearby hospital, but the results were inconclusive. ""If we were back in Sweden, I’m sure we could find out what’s wrong with her in a day,"" she added. As the meeting drew to a close and camp guards ushered her out, she whispered: ""Please try and meet my husband. ""No one has heard from him for a long time.""  The next morning, a prisoner shuffled into an office in an SDF military compound in Hasakah, northeast Syria, handcuffed and with a hood made from sacking material over his head. He was tall and walked with a limp, and the legs of his stained brown jumpsuit were rolled up, revealing scars down his shin. A guard removed the bag from the prisoner's head, and he squinted in the light as he was told to sit down on a blue and beige sofa. It was not Damaal. Al Jazeera had asked to meet Damaal, but it was neither possible to raise the issue at that moment nor to appear too curious about him. As the guard unbound his hands, the prisoner introduced himself as Erik*, a 34-year-old Swedish bus driver who had travelled to join ISIL in 2014. Erik’s face had been badly injured, and he was blind in his right eye, a result, he said, of an air strike on his former home in Raqqa. He appeared older than his age, and his hair had begun to grey - something he attributed to being separated from his wife and daughter, who had been repatriated to Sweden after stints in al-Hol and Roj. He was calm, however, and happy to answer questions, volunteering that the cramped conditions in the prison had improved with the recent installation of air conditioning. Then he brought up Damaal, whom he said he knew well. They had lived together in Baghouz in early 2019. His description of Damaal fitted with Aaden's: a calm, quiet man who avoided conflict and whose personality was at odds with many of the other battle-hardened members of the group. Damaal had told the other prisoners about his father, Erik said, and it had given him hope that if he ever made it back to Sweden, he could also pursue an education and succeed. They had been in different prison cells, but they saw each other now and then during their captivity. Damaal had told Erik that he was struggling with a chest infection but had appeared to recover. Then Erik heard from other inmates that the condition had returned, and Damaal had died in November 2022. Pressed subtly on the matter, he insisted that he was sure, adding, ""I miss him."" Al Jazeera reached out to the relevant Swedish authorities. The Swedish Foreign Ministry responded that it ""cannot confirm whether a Swedish citizen has died in Syria"". Sapo stated that it was ""not able to provide any answers"".  Aaden sat quietly on a sofa, listening intently as he was told what Erik had said about Damaal. He had been anxiously waiting for this meeting, sending numerous messages asking how his son was doing. Now, his sadness enveloped him, along with a bitter disappointment that the authorities had refused to confirm if his son had died and give his family the closure it deserved. Holding back tears, he insisted that everyone, including the social worker who had come to the meeting, eat some of the cakes and biscuits he had laid out as he poured tea for everyone. Damaal’s physical strength had always been an issue, he said. Growing up, he and his wife had struggled to get their son to eat well enough, and he had often fretted that his boy would succumb to illness in prison. The family would now need to grieve, retreating into themselves because they could not talk about their sadness as they mourned the loss of someone who was part of ISIL. That shame is something Damaal’s older sister, Almas*, finds difficult to accept because she will always remember Damaal as the ""most wonderful little brother"" who was kind, funny and helpful. Over the phone from her apartment in Stockholm, she said that since the 2021 proof of life via the ICRC, the family had wondered if he was still alive. Now, they have to get over another shock, she said, that of their own government not telling them what happened to Damaal, and that the news had come instead from a fellow prisoner, via Al Jazeera. For now, she said, the family is focused on bringing back Aamiina and her children, whom she feels a ""strong connection and love for"". But Almas and the family know it will not be easy. They believe non-ethnic Swedes who joined ISIL are being treated differently by the authorities than ethnic Swedes who did the same. Almas said this was reflected in Swedish media, which portrayed the ethnic Swedes as ""brainwashed"", while for those from a Muslim background, radicalisation was presented as having ""always been a part of them"". Several families of Swedish ISIL members whom Al Jazeera spoke to agreed with her view. ""It feels very strange because we’re Swedish, even if we have a different ethnicity. I don't have any connection to Somalia as a country. So when you’re not appreciated as a citizen and you don't get the same rights as an ethnic Swedish person, it is hard to digest,"" Almas said. The family will continue to seek confirmation of Damaal's death, Almas and Aaden said, although they believe he is likely dead and they need to focus on his widow and children. Almas, like Aamiina, believes now is a crucial time. If the children come to Sweden soon, they could recover. ""They're still quite young. They can easily learn new things and adapt, but right now, with the eldest's health condition and stunted growth, it's imperative to bring her as soon as possible,"" she said. For Aaden, the Swedish authorities must recognise their moral obligation to repatriate the children with their mother. ""The children are innocent,"" he said. ""They have done nothing to deserve this. They must come home so we can look after them.""  The children have seen families being repatriated from Roj and have begun to ask when their turn will come, Aamiina said. Her oldest often asks how they came to be in the camp, why they cannot see their family abroad, and why her life is not like those of the children she sees on TV. In 2022, the Swedish Foreign Ministry visited Roj and took DNA samples from the children. They matched them with Damaal’s parents in Sweden, which entitled the children to Swedish nationality under Swedish law. The Swedish authorities offered Aamiina a choice: Her children could go to Sweden without her and be placed in foster families. She could not return because the Swedish government had revoked her residency, but they offered no explanation as to why the children would not be able to live with their grandparents or other members of the family. Skramo, Damaal’s best friend, was of Swedish and Norwegian descent. His seven orphaned children, who were held in the al-Hol camp, were repatriated with the support of the Swedish Foreign Ministry in 2019 after their maternal grandfather, Patricio Galvez, embarked on a personal mission to rescue them. Aaden said Galvez was able to garner significant media coverage, which humanised the plight of the Swedish children and support for his cause in a way his family could not. Galvez was not granted custody of his grandchildren by social services, partly, they said, because his public profile would jeopardise the children’s protected identities. However, he is able to have contact with them. UN experts and human rights groups describe open-ended detentions in camps like al-Hol and Roj as a breach of international law. While some scrutiny falls on the authorities administering the camps, repatriating the people detained there remains the responsibility of their home governments. A 2024 UN special procedures report criticised Sweden’s ""offer"" to take Aamiina's children, finding the ""state practice of offering repatriation to children on the condition of permanent separation from their mother to be inconsistent with human rights law"". It also stated that Aamiina and her children were in a ""position of extreme vulnerability and ill health"", and that they ""seem to be detained in inhumane, cruel and degrading conditions"". In December, the Swedish Foreign Ministry responded to the UN, saying Aamiina's residency permit had been revoked and no measures to repatriate her to Sweden were under way. Swedish authorities have stifled repatriation efforts, providing rejections and using language that Louise Dane, a lawyer with the Swedish Refugee Law Centre, said can be misleading. One example, she said, was when she helped Aamiina apply for a new residence permit, but the application was rejected on what Dane said was ""very weak legal reasoning"", suggesting Aamiina is a security threat. Another was her request that the Swedish authorities confirm the children’s citizenship, a simple legal precaution during the repatriation case. The Swedish Migration Agency did not process the application, claiming both children’s parents must sign the papers - impossible since nobody had contact with Damaal. Then, the Swedish Foreign Ministry used that unprocessed citizenship application to give ""the impression that the children might not be Swedish citizens"", in response to the UN report that criticised the Swedish government, Dane said. A 2024 ruling by Denmark's Supreme Court could serve as guidance for Sweden in Aamiina’s case, Beatrice Eriksson, the cofounder and spokesperson for Repatriate the Children Sweden, told Al Jazeera. The ruling overturned Denmark’s decision not to repatriate a woman and her child, a Danish citizen, from Roj because the mother’s citizenship had been revoked after she had travelled to Syria in 2014. The mother was born in Denmark with Somali citizenship and was granted Danish citizenship when she was three. ""Denmark's Supreme Court ruling is based on the European Convention on Human Rights, which Sweden also must follow,"" Eriksson said. ""This is the only way to protect and fulfil the rights of the children and ultimately safeguard their lives. ""After all the suffering they’ve endured, having access to their primary caregiver - unless that would pose a threat to the child - is essential for their healing and reintegration into society."" Aamiina hopes Sweden will reconsider its decision and get her and the children back home. ""No one wants to stay here. It is not a place for humans,"" she said firmly. *Names have been changed to protect the identity of the individual.

"features","‘Fear is real’: Why young Kashmiris are removing tattoos of guns, ‘freedom’","19 May 2025","Mehroob Mushtaq and Numan Bhat","For years, these tattoos symbolised defiance against the Indian government. Now, thousands are erasing them amid fears of a deepening crackdown and growing scrutiny. Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir – In a quiet laser clinic in Indian-administered Kashmir’s biggest city, Srinagar, Sameer Wani sits with his arm stretched out, his eyes following the fading ink on his skin. The word “Azadi” (freedom in Urdu), once a bold symbol of rebellion against India’s rule, slowly disappears under the sting of the laser. What was once a mark of defiance has become a burden he no longer wants to carry.     As Sameer, 28, watches the ink vanish, his mind drifts to a day he will never forget. He was riding his motorbike with a friend when Indian security forces stopped them at a checkpoint. During the frisking, one of the officers pointed to the tattoo on his arm and asked, “What is this?” Sameer’s heart raced. “I was lucky he couldn’t read Urdu,” he tells Al Jazeera, his voice tinged with the memory. “It was a close call. I knew right then that this tattoo could get me into serious trouble.” When he was younger, he said, the tattoo was a “sign of strength, of standing up for something”. “But now I see it was a mistake. It doesn’t represent who I am any more. It’s not worth carrying the risk, and it’s not worth holding on to something that could hurt my future.” Sameer is one of many young Kashmiris choosing to erase tattoos that once reflected their political beliefs, emotional struggles or identity. Once worn with pride, the tattoos are now being removed in growing numbers across the region – quietly and without fanfare. While a trend to remove tattoos was already under way, the urgency has deepened since India and Pakistan – who have fought three wars over Kashmir since emerging as independent nations in 1947 – came to the brink of yet another war following the killing of 26 people in the scenic resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir last month. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of backing an armed rebellion that erupted on the Indian side in 1989. Pakistan rejects the allegation, saying it only provides moral diplomatic support to Kashmir’s separatist movement. Two weeks after Pahalgam, India, on May 7, launched predawn drone and missile attacks on what it called “terror camps” inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir – the most extensive cross-border missile strikes since their war in 1971. For the next three days, the world held its breath as the South Asian nuclear powers exchanged fire until United States President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between them on May 10. However, peace remains fragile in Indian-administered Kashmir, where a crackdown by Indian forces has left the region gripped by fear. Homes of suspected rebels have been destroyed, others have been raided, and more than 1,500 people have been arrested since the Pahalgam attack, many under preventive detention laws. In such a tense atmosphere, many Kashmiri youth say they feel exposed – and more vulnerable to scrutiny over even the most personal forms of expression. “Every time something happens between India and Pakistan, we feel it on our skin – literally,” Rayees Wani, 26, a resident of Shopian district, tells Al Jazeera. “I have a tattoo of Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani’s name on my arm, and after the Pahalgam attack, I started getting strange looks at checkpoints,” he said, referring to the separatist leader who passed away at the age of 91 in 2021. The Hurriyat is an alliance of pro-freedom groups in Indian-administered Kashmir. “Even my friends ask me uncomfortable questions. The media, police, and even the neighbours start looking at you differently,” Rayees added. “I just wish people understood that a tattoo doesn’t define someone’s loyalty or character. We are just trying to live, not explain ourselves every day. I want to erase this as soon as possible.” Arsalan, 19, from Pulwama recently booked a tattoo removal session. He did not share his last name over fears of reprisal from the authorities. “People with visible tattoos – especially those hinting at past political affiliations – are suddenly worried they could be profiled, questioned – or worse,” he said. To be sure, tattoo culture itself isn’t fading in Kashmir. Tattoo studios are still busy, especially with clients aged between 22 and 40, many of whom wait for hours to get inked. But the trend has shifted; instead of political or religious tattoos, people now prefer minimalistic designs, nature-inspired patterns, names or meaningful quotes in stylish fonts. Some Kashmiris trying to get rid of tattoos say that’s part of their personal evolution and growth. “For me, it was about being brave,” Irfan Yaqoob from Baramulla district told Al Jazeera. Now 36, Yaqoob got a slain rebel’s name tattooed on his left arm when he was a teenager. “Back then, it felt like a symbol of courage. But now, when I look at it, I realise how much I have changed. Life has moved on, and so have I. I have a family, a job, and different priorities. I don’t want my past to define me or create trouble in the present. That’s why I decided to get it removed. It’s not about shame. It’s about growth,” he said. It isn’t just the security forces that are driving this move among many Kashmiris to get rid of tattoos. For some, tattoos became painful reminders of a turbulent past. For others, they turned into obstacles, especially when they tried to move ahead professionally or wanted to align the inscription on their bodies with their personal beliefs. Anas Mir, who also lives in Srinagar, had a tattoo of a sword with “Azadi” written over it. He got it removed a few weeks ago. “People don’t clearly say why they are removing tattoos. I removed mine only because of pressure from my family,” the 25-year-old said. “It’s my choice what kind of tattoo I want. No one should judge me for it. If someone had an AK-47 or a political tattoo, that was their choice. The authorities or government shouldn’t interfere. And yes, tattoo trends also change with time,” he added, referring to the Russian-made Avtomat Kalashnikova assault rifles, arguably the most popular firearm in the world. One of the key reasons behind people removing tattoos is religion. In a Muslim-majority region, tattoos, especially those carrying religious or political messages, could often conflict with the faith’s teachings. Faheem, 24, had a Quranic verse tattooed on his back when he was 17. “At that time, I thought it was an act of faith,” he told Al Jazeera, without revealing his last name over security fears. “But later, I realised that tattoos – especially with holy verses – are not encouraged [in Islam]. It started to bother me deeply. I felt guilty every time I offered namaz [prayers] or went to the mosque. That regret stayed with me. Getting it removed was my way of making peace with myself and with my faith.” Many others said they shared the feeling. Some visit religious scholars to ask whether having tattoos affects their prayers or faith. While most are advised not to dwell on past actions, they are encouraged to take steps that bring them closer to their beliefs. “It’s not about blaming anyone,” said Ali Mohammad, a religious scholar in Srinagar. “It’s about growth and understanding. When someone realises that something they did in the past doesn’t align with their beliefs any more, and they take steps to correct it, that’s a sign of maturity, not shame.” Another key factor driving tattoo removals is job security. In Kashmir, government jobs are seen as stable and prestigious. But having a tattoo, especially one with political references, can create problems during recruitment or background checks. Talib, who disclosed his first name only, had a tattoo of a Quranic verse shaped like an AK-47 rifle on his forearm. When he applied for a government position, a family friend in law enforcement hinted it might be an issue. “He didn’t say it directly, but I could tell he was worried,” said the 25-year-old. “Since then, I have been avoiding half-sleeve shirts. I got many rejections and no one ever gave a clear reason, but deep down, I knew the tattoo was a problem. It felt like a wall between me and my future.” As the demand for tattoo removal rises, clinics in Srinagar and other parts of Indian-administered Kashmir are seeing a steady increase in clients. Laser sessions, once rare, are now booked weeks in advance. Mubashir Bashir, a well-known tattoo artist in Srinagar who also runs a tattoo removal service, said: “After a popular singer’s death in 2022, the trend of AK-47 tattoos exploded,” Bashir said. Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala, whose music often glorified guns, was killed in May 2022. Police blamed his death on an inter-gang rivalry. “But now, especially after the Pahalgam attack, we are seeing more people coming in to erase those tattoos. The fear is real,” Mubashir said. He estimated that tens of thousands of tattoos have been removed in the region over the past seven years, since 2019, when India abrogated Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status and launched a major crackdown, arresting thousands of civilians. “Some say the tattoo no longer represents them. Others mention problems at work or while travelling,” Mubashir said. Laser tattoo removal isn’t easy. It requires multiple sessions, costs thousands of rupees and can be painful. Even after successful removal, faint scars or marks often remain. But for many Kashmiris, the pain is worth it. Sameer, whose “Azadi” tattoo is almost gone, remembers the emotional weight of the process. “I didn’t cry when I got the tattoo,” he says. “But I cried when I started removing it. It felt like I was letting go of a part of myself.” Still, Sameer believes it was the right choice. “It’s not about shame,” he says. “I respect who I was. But I want to grow. I want to live without looking over my shoulder.” As he finishes another laser session, a faint scar is all that is left of the word that is Kashmir’s war-cry for freedom. “I will never forget what that tattoo meant to me when I was 18,” Sameer says as he rolls down his sleeve. “But now, I want to be someone new. I want a life where I don’t carry old shadows.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/19/fear-is-real-why-are-kashmiri-youths-removing-tattoos-from-their-bodies"
"features","Could AI help elderly people and refugees reconstruct unrecorded pasts?","18 May 2025","Anna Pivovarchuk","A child catches a glimpse of her father in one of Franco’s prisons, another sees a locomotive for the first time – how artificial intelligence is being used to create ‘synthetic memories’. In 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis in Europe, as a record 1.3 million people, mostly Syrians fleeing civil war, sought asylum, Pau Aleikum Garcia was in Athens, helping those arriving in the Greek capital after a perilous sea journey. The then 25-year-old Spanish volunteer arranged housing for refugees in abandoned facilities like schools and libraries, and set up community kitchens, language classes and art activities.     “It was kind of a massive cascade of people,” Garcia recalls. “My own memory of that time is oddly patchy,” he admits. Though there was one encounter that stood out. In one of those schools in Athens’ Exarcheia neighbourhood, where refugees painted the external wall to illustrate their memories of their journeys, Garcia met a Syrian woman in her late 70s. “I’m not afraid of being a refugee. I have lived all my life. I’m happy with what I have lived,” he recalls her telling him. “I’m afraid that my grandkids will be refugees for all their life.” When he tried to reassure her that they would find a place to start anew, she protested: “No, no, I’m worried, because when my grandkids grow [up] and they ask themselves, ‘Where do I come from?’ they won’t be able to answer that question.” The woman told him how, during the family’s journey to Greece, all but one of their photo albums were lost. Now, she said, all the memories of their lives in Syria existed only in her and her husband’s minds, unrecorded and unrecoverable for the next generation. The woman’s story stayed with Garcia after he returned to Barcelona and his work as cofounder of the design studio, Domestic Data Streamers (DDS). Over the years, the studio has grown into a 30-person team of experts in varied disciplines such as psychology, architecture, cognitive science, journalism and design. The studio has collaborated with diverse institutions such as museums, prisons and churches, as well as the likes of the United Nations, and uses technology to bring “emotions and humanity” to data visualisation. Then, in around 2019, with the rise of generative artificial intelligence – a model of machine learning that uses algorithms to create new content from data scraped from the internet – the team began to explore image-generating technology, following the release of ChatGPT. As they did, Garcia thought of the grandmother from Syria and how this technology might help someone like her by constructing images based on memories. He believes that memories – captured through records like photographs – play an integral role in connecting generations. “Memories are the architects of who we are. … It’s a big part of how social identities are built,” he says. He also likes to cite Montserrat Roig, a Catalan author, who wrote that the biggest act of love is to remember something. But in the past, people had fewer opportunities to document their lives than their mobile phone-wielding contemporaries, he says. Many experiences have been omitted or erased from collective memory due to lack of access, persecution, censorship or marginalisation. So with this in mind, in 2022, Garcia and his team launched the Synthetic Memories project to use AI to generate photographic representations of memories that were lost, due to missing photos, for instance, or never recorded in the first place. “I don’t think there was an eureka moment,” Garcia says of the evolution of the idea. “I’ve always been intrigued by how documentaries reconstruct the past … our goal and approach were more focused on the subjective and personal side, trying to capture the emotional layers of memory.” For Garcia, the chance to recover such memories is an important act in reclaiming one’s past. “The fact that you have an image that tells this happened to me, this is my memory, and this is shown and other people can see it, is also a way to say to you, ‘Yes, this happened’. It’s a way of saying, of having more dignity about the part of your history that has not been depicted.” To create a synthetic memory, DDS uses open-source image-generating AI systems such as DALL-E 2 and Flux, while the team is developing its own tool. The process starts with an interviewer asking a subject to recall their earliest memory. They explore various narratives as people recount their life stories before picking the one they think can be best encapsulated in an image. The interviewer works with a prompter – someone trained in the syntax that the AI uses to create visuals – who inputs specific words to build the image from the details described by the interviewee. Nearly everything, such as hairstyles, clothing, and furniture, is recreated as accurately as possible. However, figures themselves are usually depicted from behind or, if faces are shown, with a degree of blurriness. This is intentional. “We want to be very clear that this is a synthetic memory and this is not real photography,” says Garcia. This is partly because they want to ensure their generated images don’t add to the proliferation of fake photos on the internet. The resulting images – usually two or three from each session, which can last up to an hour – can appear dreamlike and undefined. “As we know, memory is very, very, very fragile and full of imperfections,” Garcia explains. “That was the other reason why we wanted a model that could be full of imperfections and also a bit fragile, so it’s a good demonstration of how our memory works.” Garcia’s team found that people who took part in the project said they felt a stronger connection to less detailed images, their suggestive nature allowing for their imagination to fill in the blanks. The higher the resolution, the more someone focuses on the details, losing that emotional connection to the image, Airi Dordas, the project’s lead, explains. The team first trialled this technology with their grandparents. The experience was moving, Garcia says, and one that grew into medical trials to determine whether synthetic memories can be used as an augmentation tool in reminiscence therapy for dementia sufferers. From there, the team went on to work with Bolivian and Korean communities in Brazil to tell their stories of migration, before partnering with Barcelona’s city council to document local memories. The sessions were open to the public and held last summer at the Design Museum in Barcelona, generating more than 300 memories. Some wanted to work through traumatic experiences, like one woman who was abused by a relative who avoided jail and wanted to recreate a memory of him in court to share with her family. Others recalled moments from their childhood, like 105-year-old Pepita, who recreated the day she saw a train for the first time. Couples came to relive shared experiences. There was always a moment, Ainoa Pubill Unzeta, who carried out interviews in Barcelona, says, “when people actually saw a picture that they would relate to, you could feel it … you can see it”. For some, it was just a smile; others cried. For her, this was confirmation that the image was done well. One of the first memories Garcia recorded during their pilot sessions was that of Carmen, now in her 90s. She remembers going up to a stranger’s balcony as a child, her mother having paid the owners to let them in, because it looked into the courtyard of the jail where her father, a doctor for the Republican front during the Spanish Civil War, was being held. This was the only way the family could see him from his cell window. By incredible coincidence, Carmen’s son was employed in the same prison as a social worker decades later, but neither son nor mother knew that. When the whole family came to see an installation at the Public Office of Synthetic Memories last year, her son recognised the prison immediately from his mother’s reconstruction. “It was a kind of closing the loop … it was beautiful,” Garcia says. The team was particularly interested in telling stories of civic activists who have played a key role in different social movements in the city over the last 50 years, including those concerning LGBTQ and workers’ rights. While initially the focus was not on the dictatorship era, it “naturally brought us to engage with people who, by the historical circumstances, were activists against the regime,” Dordas explains. One of them was 74-year-old Jose Carles Vallejo Calderon. Born in Barcelona in 1950 to Republican parents who faced oppression under General Francisco Franco, Vallejo came of age during one of Europe’s longest dictatorships, which lasted from 1939 to 1975. During the civil war of 1936-39, and following the defeat of the Republican forces by Franco’s Nationalists, enforced disappearances, forced labour, torture and extrajudicial killings claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people. Vallejo became involved in opposition to the fascist regime first at university, where he attempted to organise a democratic student union, and then as a young worker at Barcelona’s SEAT automobile factory. He recalls an atmosphere of fear, with most people terrified of speaking out against the authoritarian government. “That fear sprang from the terrible defeat in the Spanish Civil War and from the many deaths that occurred during the war, but also from the harsh repression from the post-war period up to the end of the dictatorship,” he explains. Informants were everywhere, and the circle of trusted individuals was small. “As you can imagine, this is no way to live – this was living in darkness, silence, fear, and repression,” Vallejo says. “There were few of us – very few – who dared to move from silence to activism, which involved many risks.” Vallejo was imprisoned in 1970 for attempting to set up a labour union among SEAT employees, spending half a year in jail, including 20 days being tortured by Barcelona’s secret police. After another arrest in late 1971 and the prosecution demanding 20 years for what were then considered crimes of association, organisation and propaganda, Vallejo crossed the border with France in January 1972. He ultimately gained political asylum in Italy, where he lived in exile before returning to Spain following the first limited amnesty of 1976, which granted pardons to political prisoners after Franco’s death in 1975. Today, Vallejo dedicates his time to human rights activism. He presides over the Catalan Association of Former Political Prisoners of Francoism, created in the final years of the dictatorship. He learned about synthetic memories through Iridia, a human rights organisation that collaborated with DDS to help visualise memories of police abuse victims during the regime in a central Barcelona police station. Vallejo was drawn to the project, curious about how the technology might be applied to capturing resistance activities too dangerous to record during Franco’s rule. In 1970, SEAT workers organised clandestine breakfasts in the woods of Vallvidrera. On Sunday mornings, disguised as hikers, they would make their way through the dense forests surrounding the Catalan capital to discuss the struggle against the dictatorship. “I think I must have been to more than 10 or 15 of these forest gatherings,” Vallejo recalls. Other times, they met in churches. No records of these exist. Vallejo’s synthetic memory of these meetings is in black and white. The image is vague, almost like someone has taken an eraser to it to blur the details. But it is still possible to make out the scene: a crowd of people gathered in a forest. Some sit, others stand beneath a canopy of trees. Looking at the image, Vallejo says he felt transported to the clandestine assemblies in the Barcelona woods, where as many as 50 or 60 people would gather in a tense atmosphere. “I found myself truly immersed in the image,” he says. “It was like entering a kind of time tunnel,” he adds. Vallejo suffered memory loss around the ordeal of his arrests, imprisonment and torture. The process of creating the image provided “a feeling – not exactly of relief – but rather of reconciling memory with the past and perhaps also of filling that void created by selective amnesia, which results from complicated, traumatic, and above all, distant experiences”. He found the reconstruction a “valuable experience” that helped him process some of these events. Emphasising that memory is subjective, Garcia says, “One of the things that we are kind of drawing a very big red line about is historical reconstruction.” This is partly due to the drawbacks of AI, which reinforces cultural and other biases in the data it draws from. David Leslie, director of ethics and responsible innovation research at the Alan Turing Institute, the United Kingdom centre for data science and AI, cautions that using data that was initially biased against marginalised groups could create revisionist histories or false memories for those communities. Nor can “simply generating something from AI” help to remedy or reclaim historical narratives, he insists. For DDS, “It is never about the bigger story. We are not reconstructing the past,” Garcia explains. “When we talk about history, we talk about one truth that somehow we are committed to,” he elaborates. But while synthetic memories can depict a part of the human experience that history books cannot, these memories come from the individual, not necessarily what transpired, he underlines. The team believes synthetic memories could not only help communities whose memories are at risk but also create dialogue between cultures and generations. They plan to set up “emergency” memory clinics in places where cultural heritage is in danger of being eroded by natural disasters, such as in southern Brazil, which was last year hit by floods. There are also hopes to make their finished tool freely available to nursing homes. But Garcia wonders what place the project could have in a future where there is an “over-registration” of everything that happens. “I have 10 images of my father when he was a kid,” he says. “I have over 200 when I was a kid. But my friend, of her daughter, [has] 25,000, and she’s five years old!” “I think the problem of memory image will be another one, which will be that we are … [overwhelmed] and we cannot find the right image to tell us the story,” he muses. Yet in the present moment, Vallejo believes the project has a role to play in helping younger generations understand past injustices. Forgetting serves no purpose for activists like himself, he believes, while memory is like “a weapon for the future”. Instead of trying to numb the past, “I think it is more therapeutic – both collectively and individually – to remember rather than to forget.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/18/could-ai-help-elderly-people-and-refugees-reconstruct-their-unrecorded-pasts"
"features","‘Exploding inequality’: The fight for the hearts and minds of Poland’s left","17 May 2025","Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska","As Poland picks its new president, the country’s left is making a new pitch too. Krakow, Poland – As Adrian Zandberg, leader of Poland’s left-wing Razem (Together) party, prepared to speak to the large crowd at his rally in one of Krakow’s central squares on Wednesday this week, he wasn’t just getting ready to contest Sunday’s presidential election. Speaking with a revolutionary zeal to the cheering crowd, Zandberg put forward his ideals: Quality public services, affordable housing for all, investment in education and science and the end to a toxic right-wing duopoly in Polish politics.     Zandberg is one of two presidential hopefuls of Poland’s left – the other is Magdalena Biejat of the Lewica (The Left) party. Between the two of them, they represent a political force that has long remained on the margins of politics. Sunday’s contest is also a fight for the leadership of this movement which is popular with urban, generally younger people. Opinion polls suggest that the final presidential battle – first-round voting takes place on Sunday – will be between the two favourites, Rafał Trzaskowski and Karol Nawrocki, representatives of right-wing parties Civic Platform and Law and Justice (PiS) which have dominated the country’s political scene for the past 20 years. Nevertheless, Zandberg was confident and full of passion as he addressed his supporters. “I believe that we can build a different, better Poland. I believe that we can afford for Poland to become a country with decent public services,” he declared. “That we can afford for people in the 20th economy in the world to stop dying in line to see a doctor. That we can afford for young, hard-working people to be able to rent a roof over their heads for a normal price, so that they can afford to start a family.” Calling the current system “unconstitutional” and one which “explodes with inequalities”, he called for a change. The system, he said, “is a threat to the future of Poland”. Like other left-wing politicians, he has been a staunch critic of the neoliberal views of the two main candidates, their lack of commitment to securing affordable housing for people (which is a constitutional right), attempts to privatise the healthcare system, and their seeming embrace of rising anti-migrant sentiment within the country. The day before, in another square in central Krakow, Biejat, Zandberg’s main competitor for the hearts and minds of Poland’s left and deputy marshal of the Senate, stood before her own crowd of supporters. Unlike Zandberg’s Razem, her party, Lewica, is part of the ruling Civic Coalition along with the centre-right Civic Platform. Lewica’s decision to enter the coalition government in late 2023 prompted criticism among some on the left, and has become the main bone of contention between the two leftist presidential candidates. Speaking at her rally on Tuesday, Biejat defended the decision to join the coalition as the right one. According to her, it has allowed her party to have a real effect on politics in Poland. She listed their achievements: “It is thanks to Lewica being in the government that we managed to introduce a pension supplement for widows. We managed to introduce a pilot programme which shortened working hours. We managed to increase the funeral allowance,” Biejat said. “We have changed the definition of rape, so that women no longer have to explain to the judges that it was not their fault that someone had hurt them. Thanks to us, parents of premature babies have received additional leave days for each week spent in hospital with a small child.” The Krakow crowd, albeit smaller than Zandberg’s, cheered Biejat’s declarations of support for the rights of women, LGBTQ people and those with disabilities and for affordable housing. The two-term presidency of the left-wing Aleksander Kwasniewsk, an independent but also one of the founders of the Democratic Left Alliance, was highly successful. Under his presidency, which ended in 2005, Poland joined NATO and the European Union and introduced a new constitution. Since his departure, however, the left has been in crisis. While the ideals of the left-wing candidates barely differ from those of left-wing candidates in other European countries, their appeal in Poland is limited these days as people have become disillusioned with immigration, and resentment towards the one million Ukrainian refugees taking shelter from the war with Russia has grown. According to Politico’s latest aggregate poll, the two leftist candidates are each expected to win 5 percent of the vote. In the most recent European election in 2024, Lewica secured just 6.3 percent of the vote, the lowest score in its history. In the most recent parliamentary elections of 2023, the party secured just 5.3 percent of the vote. The question now is whether leftist parties can start to make a comeback. Some observers see signs of a possible resurgence – but it is fragile. “Any result above 5 percent for each of the candidates [in the upcoming presidential contest] would be a good score. And below 4 percent – a bad one,” said Bartosz Rydlinski, a political scientist at Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw. He credits Zandberg with “restarting the Razem party project” by appealing to younger voters. “Recent studies show that he is competing with Slawomir Mentzen [the highly popular ultraconservative and free-market-enthusiast leader of the Confederation Party] to be number one among the youngest voters. “Magdalena Biejat, on her part, represents women from the middle class, living in large cities. She is their mirror image. The election will show which one of them is more popular,” Rydlinski said.  At the last presidential election five years ago, Robert Biedron of Lewica, who now serves as a Polish member of the European parliament (MEP), won just 2.2 percent of the vote. This time around, the left is expected to do better, but its appeal remains limited. According to experts, the left has lost much of its traditional support base to the nationalist conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which attracted voters with generous welfare packages. In this presidential election, Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by PiS, is expected to take 25 percent of the vote in the first round, according to Politico’s aggregate poll. This is despite the fact that Nawrocki has abandoned Law and Justice’s commitment to social welfare and has embraced free-market thinking with a focus on strengthening an alliance with the US while distancing Poland from the EU. His main competitor,Rafał Trzaskowski of the centre-right Civic Platform, is polling at 31 percent.  “The left is continuously trying to win back pro-social Law and Justice voters, but so far it has failed,” Jakub Majmurek, a commentator at the left-wing Krytyka Polityczna media outlet, told Al Jazeera. “First of all, because these voters are often calculating and feel that the Law and Justice is a much more credible welfare provider than the weak left. “Second, these voters are largely pro-church and much more conservative when it comes to social issues than the left.” A good result for the left in the Sunday election could have the effect of bringing left-wing politics back to the agenda, analysts say, and make some inroads into reversing the long-term trend of far-right and centre-right politicians dominating government. “If the combined result of Biejat and Zandberg is around 10 percent, in the second election round, Trzaskowski or even Nawrocki will have to try to claim this left-wing electorate somehow,” Majmurek explained. “That would be the best scenario for the left. Especially if both candidates receive a similar percentage of the vote. That would show that none of them is a hegemon and cannot build the left without the other.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/17/exploding-inequality-the-fight-for-the-hearts-and-minds-of-polands-left"
"features","Malaysia’s ‘fish hunters’ target invasive species, one catch at a time","17 May 2025","Patrick Lee","Invasive species are an issue the world over, and waterways in mega-biodiverse Malaysia are threatened by imported fish. Puchong, Malaysia – On a recent Sunday morning, about a dozen men with fishing nets skirted the rubbish-strewn banks of the Klang River just outside the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. Surveying the river, the men cast their nets into the polluted water. The nets billowed open and sunk quickly under the weight of metal chains. From where they stood on the riverbank, they started to pull in their nets, already filled with dozens of squirming black-bodied catfish. “You don’t see any other fish. Only these,” said Mohamad Haziq A Rahman, the leader of Malaysia’s “foreign fish hunter squad”, as they emptied their catch of wriggling suckermouth catfish into piles, away from the river. None of the fish caught that morning were sold at nearby markets or food stalls. The sole purpose of the expedition was to cull suckermouth catfish, one among a growing number of invasive species that have in recent decades dominated freshwater habitats across Southeast Asia. Once brought in for commercial or hobbyist reasons, invasive fish are not only threatening to edge native species out of the food chain in Malaysia and elsewhere, but they also spread diseases and cause great damage to local environments. Invasive fish are a problem the world over, but experts say the issue is keenly felt in mega-biodiverse Malaysia. “More than 80 percent of rivers in the Klang Valley have been invaded by foreign fish species, which can cause the extinction of the rivers’ indigenous aquatic life,” said Dr Kalithasan Kailasam, a river expert with the Malaysia-based Global Environment Centre. “It’s growing in almost all other main rivers in Malaysia,” said Kailasam, explaining how species such as the suckermouth have the potential to quickly reproduce and survive in dirty water, leaving local fish on the losing side. Aside from the suckermouth, Malaysia’s waterways are now threatened by species such as the aggressive peacock bass, Javanese carp and redtail catfish, he said. While the full extent of the problem is not yet known, Malaysia’s fisheries department, after a four-year study until 2024, found invasive species in 39 areas across nearly every state in peninsular Malaysia and on the island of Labuan, including in dams, lakes and major rivers. Alarmed by the threat, a small group of citizens banded together to fight the aquatic invaders. Led by Haziq, they are working to reclaim Malaysia’s rivers one fin at a time. The citizen fish hunters’ quest to fight invasive species started during the country’s COVID-19 lockdowns, when Haziq, a former healthcare consultant, turned to fishing as a pastime in a river near his house in central Selangor state. He found every fish he caught was of the suckermouth variety, also known as the “pleco” or “ikan bandaraya” – which translates as the “janitor fish” in Malay and is favoured by hobbyists to keep aquariums clean, as the suckermouth feeds on algae, leftover food and dead fish. Native to South America, varieties of the suckermouth have also been introduced into waterways in the United States, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, often when owners dump them into rivers, canals, dams or free them after they grow too large for their aquarium tanks. Because of their thick, scaly skin, suckermouths are usually avoided by even larger predators in Malaysia, and can grow to about half a metre (1.6ft) in length. As bottom feeders, the catfish have been known to eat the eggs of other species and destroy their nesting sites. Catfish also burrow into riverbanks to nest, causing them to erode and collapse, which is a serious environmental issue in flood-prone Malaysia where year-end monsoon winds bring heavy rain. Malaysia’s central bank said in 2024 that floods are the cause of 85 percent of the country’s natural disasters, with their frequency increasing since 2020.­ Though far from his favourite fish to catch, Haziq discovered that suckerfish roe could be used as bait for other bigger fish, and he earned some money selling their eggs to other fishing enthusiasts. He also gained a following by putting his exploits on social media. Further research then led him to learn about the threats posed by invasive species. Haziq started to attract like-minded anglers, and, in 2022, they decided to form a group for hunting suckermouth, meeting nearly every week in a river to carry out a cull. Their public profile and popularity are growing. The group’s membership has now grown to more than 1,000, and it has a strong fan following on social media. “People kept asking how to join our group, because we were looking at the ecosystem,” Haziq said. Focusing first on Malaysia’s Selangor state and rivers in the capital Kuala Lumpur, the fish hunter squad had netted nearly 31 tonnes of suckermouths by 2024. They have also visited rivers in other states in Malaysia as their campaign expands. During a hunt in the Klang River earlier this year, Haziq and his comrades deployed to the river’s banks on a mission to see how many suckermouth they could catch during a single outing. But hunting for invasive fish can be tricky. Without boats, the hunters have to wade into the fast-moving polluted waters from muddy banks, while navigating underwater debris such as rubbish on the riverbed. Almost all the fish they caught were of the invasive kind, but once in a while, they do net a local. “Haruan (snakehead)!” shouted ex-navy diver Syuhaily Hasibullah, 46, as he showed off a small fish half the size of his arm, taken from a net containing several suckermouths. “This one is rare! There used to be a lot of them in the river,” he told Al Jazeera. Haziq said if the hunters found many invasive species in their nets, they would organise another outing to the same location, bringing along more people to take part. The day they set out to calculate how many invasive fish they could catch in a single outing turned out to yield half a tonne of suckermouth in just three hours – so many they had to stuff them into sacks. Previously, the hunters buried their hauls in deep holes away from the river. Now, they have found more creative ways to dispose of what is, generally, an unwanted fish. At the event earlier this year, sacks of suckermouths were handed over to a local entrepreneur looking to experiment with turning the fish into a form of charcoal known as biochar. Some local universities have also started researching the possible use of the suckermouth. One university research article explored the potential of suckermouth collagen for pharmaceutical use, while another considered its use as fertiliser or even as a type of leather. On some occasions, the hunters even eat the fish they catch, though that depends on which river they have been taken from. While redtail or African catfish are considered delicacies by some, the suckermouth, also known in India as “devil fish”, is a less attractive snacking option – but not out of the question when it comes to a quick riverside grill. “If the fish is from the Klang River, we don’t eat it,” Mohd Zulkifli Mokhtar told Al Jazeera, before dozens of hunters broke their fast during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. “But if it’s from the Langat River, it’s still OK,” Zulkifli said, as dozens of suckermouth caught in the less polluted Langat River, located in Bangi some 25km (16 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur, were gutted, marinated in satay and grilled on skewers. Studies from Bangladesh and Indonesia have found varieties of catfish with high levels of heavy metals and contaminants. A 2024 article by Malaysia’s Universiti Teknologi Mara cited a study that showed the level of contaminants in the suckermouth was “heavily influenced by the level of pollution in the river”. While Malaysia’s fisheries department said there were no records of local species becoming endangered because of invasive ones, native fish nevertheless face threats. Local fish either faced becoming prey or have had to fight to survive, with the department finding in a survey that 90 percent of the fish in six rivers in the Selangor and Kuala Lumpur region were now foreign arrivals. The department’s Director-General Adnan Hussain said various measures had been put in place, including the release of some 33.6 million native fish and prawns into rivers nationwide from 2021 to 2025 to “balance the impact” of invasive fish. Late last year, the state government of Selangor also came up with a scheme to pay anglers one Malaysian ringgit ($0.23) for every kilogramme (2.2lb) of the suckermouth fish removed from two rivers. The captured fish were to be turned into animal feed and organic fertiliser, an official said. Restrictions on the import of certain foreign aquatic species – including entire species and groups – into Malaysia were also imposed last year, and the fisheries department said that programmes and collaboration with the fish hunters had also helped to deal with the problem. In one river in Selangor state, Adnan said the amount of invasive fish caught following one eradication programme had dropped from 600kg (1,300lb) in a May 2024 event to just more than 150kg (330lb) four or five months later. However, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu fish researcher Professor Amirrudin Ahmad said it was “almost impossible” to fully exterminate the country’s invasive fish. “So many species live in (native water bodies) and getting rid of invasive species by the means of poisoning the water is not feasible at all,” he said, adding there were close to 80 recorded fish species introduced in Malaysia so far. He further warned that rising temperatures caused by climate change may even allow species like the predatory Mekong redtail catfish to proliferate in cooler upstream waters in Malaysia. “They are here to stay,” Amirrudin said. “It is simply,” he said, “that the environment is mostly similar to their native country, or these species are highly adaptable.” That this is an ecological war that can never truly be won is a point that Haziq and his fellow fish hunters are fully aware of. Nearly every river they visited in recent times had almost nothing but invasive fish, he said. But their mission will carry on, he added, along with the hunting and public awareness that has spurred thousands to follow his social media videos on the subject. “Yes, this fish won’t be completely gone from our rivers,” he told Al Jazeera. “But if we don’t act now, it would be worse,” he said. “It’s better to take action than to just leave it alone,” he added. “At least we can reduce the population, than allow it to completely take over our local fish.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/17/malaysias-fish-hunters-target-invasive-species-one-catch-at-a-time"
"features","Poland presidential election 2025: From migration to EU, what’s at stake?","16 May 2025","Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska","The two main contenders may disagree on the EU, but they have both embraced anti-migrant sentiment. Krakow, Poland – The two main contenders for Poland’s presidential election on Sunday locked horns over Europe and traded personal barbs this week as they each made final bids for the support of floating voters. The winner will take over from current President Andrzej Duda, of the nationalist conservative Law and Justice party, at a crucial point when neighbouring Ukraine is battling Russia, and when cooperation between the government and the president is vital to push through reforms.     Looking visibly tired at his rally on Tuesday, Rafal Trzaskowski of the ruling centre-right Civic Platform, stood on a platform at Krakow’s central Market Square amid a large crowd cheering his name, blue European flags fluttering beside the white-and-red Polish ones. “I didn’t think it would be necessary to remind all of us, especially my main competitor, that honesty is the most important thing, human decency is the most important thing, and selflessness is the most important thing,” said Trzaskowski, referring to a recent news story about his competitor Karol Nawrocki, an independent candidate supported by the opposition Law and Justice party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023. Nawrocki allegedly purchased a flat in Gdansk belonging to an elderly man in exchange for a promise to provide him with care. According to the man’s family, the promise was not fulfilled, and he was placed in a state nursing home. In response, Nawrocki has said he will donate the flat to charity and pointed out that under Trzaskowski’s mayorship, families had been evicted from state accommodation in Warsaw. Nawrocki’s rally in Zabrze took a different tone – and featured a special guest. Alongside George Simion, the ultranationalist winner of the first round of Romania’s presidential election on May 4, Nawrocki took aim at the EU. “Together with Romania, when George Simion wins and when we win on May 18, we will build a Europe of Homelands, in which we will not allow the European Union to centralise and turn Poland and Romania into its provinces,” Nawrocki said. Simion, together with the crowd, chanted “Donald Trump!” and called the United States president “a symbol of the fight for freedom which will transform the whole Europe”. Earlier this month, Nawrocki, who argues that Poland should focus on an alliance with the US rather than the EU, met with Trump in the White House and allegedly received his backing. In the race for floating votes, both candidates have eased up on some of their parties’ more traditional positions. Nawrocki has abandoned Law and Justice’s commitment to a welfare state in exchange for a message of free market liberalism. The more liberal Trzaskowski, for his part, has kept relatively quiet about women’s and LGBTQ rights, and embraced a harder line on security and immigration by promising to cut benefits for unemployed Ukrainians who have taken refuge in Poland from the war with Russia and endorsing his government’s suspension of asylum rights last year over what Poland sees as Belarus facilitating migrants to cross their shared border. Security and anti-migrant rhetoric have been a key feature in this election, as both main candidates lean closer to the views of the populist Slawomir Mentzen, a tax adviser turned leader of the ultranationalist, conservative Confederation party. He has called for migrants crossing from Belarus to be fired upon, is opposed to welfare payments for Ukrainians and is likely to emerge as third in the presidential race. “In public opinion polls and focus groups, among all voters, including voters of the new left, there has been a visible anti-Ukrainian trend, which has social and economic rather than cultural roots,” said Bartosz Rydlinski, a political scientist from Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw. “Poles are not angry at Ukrainians for living separately or not speaking Polish. [But] in a country with highly limited access to public services, there is an irrational sense of injustice. There is a sense that Ukrainians do not work, but use healthcare. Which is nonsense, because most Ukrainians work and pay taxes.” At the Krakow meeting, amid the sea of Polish and European flags, the crowd rallied for value-based politics – and change. “I want to live in a normal country, I want my daughter to grow up in a normal country, in a country with a positive attitude, without any negative emotions. Poland deserves to develop, to be respected in the world and that is why I came here today,” Anna Szol, a 48-year-old entrepreneur, who joined Trzaskowski’s rally with her daughter, told Al Jazeera. When asked about the situation at the Polish-Belarusian border – where, since 2021, thousands of migrants to Europe have crossed – and the suspension of asylum rights, Szol, just like her candidate, said she agrees that the move is justified. “This is the result of Putin’s and Lukashenko’s actions to send to the border poor people who are not aware of what’s going on. Human traffickers are often involved. This is a NATO border and it simply has to be extra secure,” Szol said. However, Rydlinski said such a suspension of human rights would embolden the far-right agenda in the longer term and weaken liberal parties. “The difference between liberal and populist parties should be that liberal parties treat human rights seriously,” Rydlinski says. “Research shows that when liberal and left-wing parties accommodate far-right issues, they do not win populist voters, but lose their own.” The winner of this presidential election will be crucial for the current government, which has been hamstrung from carrying out reforms by the current president, who has used his power of veto to block them. This includes the reversal of controversial judicial reforms introduced by the Law and Justice government during its eight-year rule. The European Court of Justice deemed several Law and Justice judicial reforms as contradicting EU law, especially regarding the independence of the judiciary, and imposed penalties on Poland beginning in 2021. “What is at stake in the election is whether the current government is going to be able to carry out its programme in full. One of the key things that has been characteristic of the political scene over the last 18 months is that the government has been essentially blocked in a number of things that it has committed to do,” said Ben Stanley, a sociologist and political scientist at the SWPS University in Warsaw. “If Nawrocki wins, it will certainly lead to the maintenance of the situation as it is currently with a hostile president vetoing or threatening to veto what the government wants to do. That will affect both the rule of law issues and also many of the elements on the government’s legislative agenda,” Stanley said. “It will also send a signal to voters that Law and Justice is capable of winning the next election and that if it does win the next elections [in November 2027], it will have its president in place.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/16/poland-presidential-election-2025-from-migration-to-eu-whats-at-stake"
"features","‘New paradigm’: A fractured Portugal votes again, amid corruption cloud","16 May 2025","Ana Naomi de Sousa","Housing is unaffordable. Migrants are a flashpoint issue. The far right is here to stay. And Portugal is deeply divided as it heads to its third general election in three years. Lisbon, Portugal — Portugal is summoning its citizens to vote in their third general elections in three years on May 18, amid rapid shifts to the country’s political landscape that have left the country facing the prospect of yet another fractured mandate after decades of relative stability. This year’s snap election comes at a moment when rising living costs, a housing crisis, the future of the national health service and perceptions of immigration are all significant issues on the public agenda – as is a corruption scandal that precipitated the upcoming vote.     The government of Prime Minister Luis Montenegro, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), fell in March, when parliament voted against a motion of confidence, triggering elections. It’s the second Portuguese government in a row that had left office under a cloud of corruption allegations. Now, the country’s 10 million voters will need to choose the makeup of their next parliament, where 230 seats are up for grabs – and a divided mandate appears likely. Montenegro led a right-wing minority government for less than a year before accusations of corruption emerged over a consultancy firm that he set up, called “Spinumviva”. A string of media investigations into potential conflicts of interest revealed the firm had received thousands of euros a month in consultancy fees from previously undisclosed clients, including companies with government contracts. When a defiant Montenegro appeared on national television back in March to issue his response, he insisted that he had not broken the law because he had transferred his shares in the company to his wife and sons before he became prime minister in 2024. But his defence is controversial, say experts. “Under Portuguese civil law, even if it was possible to sell shares to someone you’re married to, you’d still be a joint owner of them, and, therefore, still able to profit from them,” said Portuguese lawyer and political commentator Carmo Afonso. “Spinumviva is a very serious case – and revelations are still emerging.” Just hours before a live debate a few weeks later with his main rival, the Socialist Party’s Pedro Nuno Santos, Montenegro submitted an updated declaration of his business interests to the national online transparency portal. According to an investigation by the Portuguese newspaper Expresso, some of Spinumviva’s clients earned at least 100 million euros ($112m) a year in government contracts during Montenegro’s mandate alone. Montenegro, meanwhile, says that he has not been involved with Spinumviva since becoming prime minister in March 2024. Still, the attention on Spinumviva may not have damaged Montenegro’s chances of re-election. According to Portuguese political scientist Vicente Valentim, “perceptions of corruption in Portugal are traditionally high, but it may not to be a significant factor in how people vote”. Despite the ongoing scandal, the conservative Democratic Alliance (AD) coalition, in which Montenegro’s Social Democratic Party (PSD) is the majority party, leads the race, and is polling at 34 percent. And according to a poll by Lisbon’s Catholic University, a third of voters think the Spinumviva case and its potential legal ramifications are irrelevant to the elections. Montenegro’s brief period in government has seen him enjoy the support of the professional class, riding on a budget surplus attained by the previous government of the centrist Socialist Party (PS) of Antonio Costa, who was prime minister from 2015-2024. Meanwhile, “the loss of the charismatic Antonio Costa has affected the PS’s popularity,” says Afonso. “Costa is a hard act to follow.” “Ironically, the more Spinumviva gets talked about, the better it is for Montenegro, is what some commentators are saying,” says Afonso, who believes Montenegro was well aware of this when the government collapsed. “Montenegro chose to bring a vote of confidence in parliament knowing full well that he would lose it, because there really couldn’t be a better time to hold elections – better for him, that is.” The PS, by contrast, is polling several points below the AD at about 26 percent. Currently, it looks highly improbable that any of the parties or alliances running will win an outright majority of 116 seats or more. That leaves two likely possibilities: either a post-electoral coalition of parties that forms a majority in alliance; or a minority government, which needs the tacit support of other parties in parliament to push through essential legislation, including budgets. About half a dozen parties are serious contenders for the rest of the 230 seats in parliament. These include the traditional players such as the Communist Party-Greens alliance (CDU), the Left Bloc, and the People-Animals-Nature party, as well as new parties including the Europeanist-Socialist party Livre (“Free”), the radical right-wing Iniciativa Liberal (“Liberal Initiative”), and the extreme right Chega (“Enough”). Chega, which opposes immigration, abortion, and LGBTQ rights, and has targeted minorities like Portugal’s substantial Romani population, won a surprising 50 parliamentary seats in the 2024 elections, with Andre Ventura as leader. It won 18 percent of the national vote. The party is currently in third position in the polls and is predicted to win close to what it did in the last elections. Valentim, the political scientist, warns against interpreting Chega’s support base as representing a protest vote. “A lot of people who vote for them already held the ideas they espoused, long before the party actually appeared; generally, the rapid growth of radical right-wing parties is not down to them changing people’s ideas,” he said. “So, Chega going from 1 percent of votes, to 7 percent, to 18 percent over the course of the last three elections doesn’t mean that the number of people with right-wing ideas has grown in those proportions.” What it means, he said, is that “more and more people who already had those ideas, but used to feel that they were not socially acceptable, and that they would be judged, or made social pariahs or disadvantaged professionally because of them, no longer feel that”. With the campaign period now well under way, Chega has been appealing to potential voters who might normally abstain. While polls suggest the party might not make major gains compared with the 2024 election, Valentim said he believes it’s here to stay. “Portugal was previously the exception in the European landscape, because no far-right party had had any notable success there; that’s no longer the case,” he said. “We can be fairly certain in saying that Chega is not going to just disappear, as suddenly as it appeared. The political landscape has changed, definitively.” And that has a range of consequences, he said. “Citizens and politicians feeling at greater ease to express extreme right-wing ideas in public,” he said. There’s “greater polarisation around specific issues such as immigration and minority rights, and, of course, the dilemma of how the more traditional centre right deals with the far right”. Under Montenegro, the PSD has maintained it will not cut a deal with Chega. However, its options for forming a government are limited. According to Valentim, centre-right parties often try to overcome the popularity of new radical right parties by shifting further right themselves – including, at times, by forming partnerships with them. That rarely actually works for the centre right, he said. “Power-sharing agreements with the extreme right legitimise those parties, without actually bring any long-term gains for the centre right,” he said. “Studies have shown that the rapprochement of the centre right to the far right neither takes votes away from the far right, nor does it bring more votes back to the centre right. But it does result in a normalising of extreme right discourse, turning extreme right-wing ideas like xenophobia more acceptable.” This effect was visible even before election campaigning began on the issue of immigration, which Portugal has actively encouraged in recent years. Almost a quarter of Portuguese companies now employ foreign workers, according to the Bank of Portugal. According to a study by the Francisco Manuel dos Santos Foundation in December, the number of immigrants in Portugal tripled between 2015 and 2023. However, right-wing parties have also stirred a backlash against immigration, and in particular the presence of agricultural and shop workers from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The FMS Foundation report showed that negative perceptions of migrants outweighed positive ones considerably – with 67 percent of the people they polled responding that they thought the presence of foreigners was associated with an increase in crime. Last year, Chega brought a motion to parliament for a national referendum on immigration but was voted down. Earlier this month, Montenegro’s government notified 4,500 migrants that they would have to leave the country within 20 days. Following the permanent closure of the border agency SEF in 2024, the government cancelled a scheme that allowed migrants originating from outside the European Union to apply for residency once already working in the country. Some of those facing deportation have been waiting several years for a reply on their applications, and thousands more such notices are expected in the coming months. These policies sit in contrast with Portugal’s demographic situation, with a falling birthrate, an ageing population and a declining fertility rate. In addition, it suffers from an ongoing trend of youth emigration – about 30 percent of the population between 15 and 39 is living abroad, one of the highest rates in the world.  A study from Porto University in December 2024 said that Portugal would need to ensure 138,000 immigrants arriving per year to guarantee economic growth over the next decade. Meanwhile, a housing crisis is the biggest ongoing issue in Portugal in the run-up to the elections. House prices rose by 106 percent between 2015 and 2023, according to the Francisco Manuel dos Santos Foundation, compared with 48 percent in Spain and 8 percent in Italy. The increase in property value has been caused by deregulation, large influxes of foreign investment in properties, speculation on real estate and a tourism boom. As a result, young people and professionals are increasingly unable to afford housing in cities like Lisbon and Porto, where soaring rents have also prompted the closures of small businesses, and left low-income tenants stretched to pay rents or facing eviction. Rising housing prices have also contributed to a general increase in the cost of living, with energy and food prices rising. Factors such as the war in Ukraine – because of its effect on the global supply chain – have amplified this crisis. As of Thursday night, almost 20 percent of voters were undecided, meaning a range of outcomes is possible after the Sunday vote: An AD-led minority government, a less likely PS-led minority government, or a coalition between a variety of political players. If that happens, it would be the second time a row that Portugal will not have a majority government: The AD won 80 seats in 2024 out of 230, just ahead of the PS, which won 78. To Valentin, this is no longer an anomaly – he expects this scenario to be repeated in future elections, too. “Portuguese democracy went through a very long period of relative stability,” he said, reflecting on the fact that Portugal this year celebrated 50 years since its first fully free elections, following the overthrow of the Estado Novo dictatorship. “For decades it had a multiparty system that barely changed, with governments alternating between the centre left PS and centre right PSD, and some interventions by a small number of other parties.” “But now there’s been a lot of changes in a short period of time, with more and more new parties having made it into parliament,” he added. That has meant fewer votes for the mainstream centrist parties, the PS and the PSD, as newer parties like Chega eat into their traditional base. “We’re now entering a new paradigm,” said Valentin. “And it remains to be seen how these different political forces will balance out.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/16/new-paradigm-a-fractured-portugal-votes-again-amid-corruption-cloud"
"features","Trump’s decision to lift Syria sanctions fuels dreams of economic revival","16 May 2025","Justin Salhani","Analysts say that sanctions relief will be a boon to Syria, but may take some time to affect the country. In Syria, optimism abounds. The unexpected decision by United States President Donald Trump to lift sanctions on the country, announced in Riyadh on Tuesday, is a relief for Syrians. They hope that the move will reintegrate Syria into the global economy, and bring much-needed investment into a country trying to recover from more than 50 years of dynastic family rule, as well as a nearly 14-year-long war. The impact of Trump’s statement, which he said would give Syria “a chance at greatness” after the December overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, had an almost immediate effect, as the Syrian pound strengthened against the US dollar by about 25 percent, in a boost to a country suffering through economic hardship. “Lifting sanctions on Syria represents a fundamental turning point,” Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist and banking expert, told Al Jazeera. “The Syrian economy will transition from interacting with developing economies to integrating with more developed ones, potentially significantly reshaping trade and investment relations.”    While the announcement will likely lead to some imminent progress, there are still some stumbling blocks to the sanctions removal, analysts and experts told Al Jazeera. US sanctions on Syria date back to 1979, when the country was under the iron grip of President Hafez al-Assad – Bashar’s father – and designated a “state sponsor of terrorism”. In the intervening years, additional sanctions were placed on the state and individuals associated with both the regime and the opposition, including current President Ahmed al-Sharaa – a result of his former association with al-Qaeda. “There’s an entire building of a complex gamut of sanctions,” Vittorio Maresca di Serracapriola, sanctions lead analyst for Karam Shaar Advisory Limited, a consulting company with a focus on the political economy of the Middle East, told Al Jazeera. Analysts said that Trump could remove certain sanctions through executive order, while some “foreign terrorist organisation” (FTO) designations could be removed by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. But other sanctions may be more complicated to end. According to Maresca di Serracapriola, there are also a series of export controls, executive orders that target the banking sector, and acts that were passed by the US Congress. “It is a huge moment for the country,” Maresca di Serracapriola said. “Of course, sanctions are very technical and complicated tools, so it’s still unclear how the US government will be able to implement what it promised.” There are also questions about the timeline. The economic situation for many Syrians is dire, with 90 percent of the population living in poverty and approximately 25 percent jobless, according to the United Nations. The new Syrian authority is under extreme economic pressure, while at times struggling to exert its authority and provide security around the country. Trump’s decision will come as a welcome reprieve, but Syrians may have to wait for sanctions relief to take effect. Analysts said the changes would come gradually and could take up to a year before “tangible results” are seen. Sanctions relief alone will also not be enough. Analysts noted that Syria still needs banking reforms to comply and get off international monitoring lists. There will also need to be incentives from the US and other international actors to build trust among private investors looking to invest in Syria’s future. “Achieving long-term growth requires implementing internal economic reforms, including improving the business environment, enhancing financial transparency, and developing productive sectors to ensure the Syrian economy effectively benefits from global opportunities,” Qushji said. “Lifting economic sanctions on Syria is a first step toward restructuring the economy, but it requires reform policies focused on sustainable development and global economic integration to ensure a real and productive recovery.”    For months, everyone from Syria’s new leadership, analysts, and international actors has said there is a dire need for sanctions relief. But the US has previously taken an inflexible stance against al-Sharaa’s government, due to perceived ties to violence and armed groups. Regional powers like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkiye, however, have built strong relations with the new government in Damascus. Before Trump’s pronouncement on Tuesday, multiple analysts told Al Jazeera they did not expect Syria’s sanctions relief to be high up on the agenda for the US or the Gulf states Trump visited during his three-country tour. The US has taken a cautious, and at times conflicting, approach to Syria’s new authority since the fall of the Assad regime on December 8.  On March 9, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Syria’s new government for their failure to prevent sectarian violence and massacres in the country’s coastal region. But then, three days later, Rubio praised the agreement between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Syrian central government in Damascus that ostensibly would see the SDF integrate into state institutions. Previously, the US provided Syria a list of demands that included destroying the remaining chemical weapons, cooperation on “counterterrorism”, and the removal of foreign fighters from senior roles in the new government or military. There have also been suggestions that Syria might throw in a Trump Tower deal in Damascus and that Trump wanted ties between Syria and Israel before any sanctions relief. But by Tuesday evening, everything had changed. Trump announced he would remove sanctions on Syria without conditions. “The key emphasis here is it’s a Saudi-US deal rather than something between the US and Syria,” Rob Geist Pinfold, a lecturer in defence studies at King’s College in London. Then, on Wednesday morning, Trump and al-Sharaa met for a little more than half an hour in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and with Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan phoning in. The meeting appeared to please Trump. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to Doha, Trump called al-Sharaa a “young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.” After the talks, the White House released a list of issues Trump discussed with al-Sharaa. They included some of the US’s prior demands on Syria, such as dealing with foreign fighters and “counterterrorism” cooperation. But Trump also brought up Syria recognising Israel, as well as taking over ISIL detention centres in northern Syria. “These don’t appear to be preconditions, but they could slowroll the lifting [of sanctions],” Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Al Jazeera.

"features","In Gaza, the Nakba is being relived in 2025","15 May 2025","Ruwaida Amer","Ruwaida Amer’s grandparents lived through the Nakba in 1948. Now, in 2025, she is experiencing another catastrophe. The Nakba. It’s a concept that accompanied me from birth until I lived through it myself these past two years. I was born a refugee in the Khan Younis camp, known by the city’s residents as the largest gathering of refugees expelled from their lands during the Nakba, when Israel was founded in 1948. Whenever someone asked me my name, it was always followed by: “Are you a refugee or a citizen?”    As a child, I would ask: “What is a refugee?” I attended a school run by UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, and my documents always had to include proof that I was a refugee. I received treatment at UNRWA clinics, always needing to bring that refugee card. I spent a lot of time trying to understand what being a refugee meant. How did my grandparents flee their land in Beit Daras, a village north of the Gaza Strip that no longer exists? How did my grandfather end up in this camp, and why did he choose this place? Before Israel’s war on Gaza, May 15, or Nakba Day, the day Palestinians commemorate the Nakba, was a unique occasion. Everyone paid attention to it, seeking out people who had lived through it to hear their stories. When I began working as a journalist in 2015, Nakba Day was one of the events I looked forward to covering. That year, I went along with colleagues to the Shati camp, west of Gaza City. It would be my first time writing about the Nakba, and my first visit to a refugee camp in 13 years, since we had moved from camp life to village life in al-Fukhari, south of Khan Younis. When I entered the camp, memories of my childhood in Khan Younis came flooding back: the small, crowded houses, some newly built, others still original structures. It was nice that the commemoration falls in May, with good weather. Elderly men and women sat by their doors, just as my grandmother did when I was a child. I used to love sitting with her; she seemed used to open spaces, like her pre-1948 home in Beit Daras. We sat with elderly women, all over 70. They talked about their homeland, the stability they had in their lands, their simple lives, the food they grew and ate, and the heartbreak of not being able to return. We met many – from Majdal, Hamama, and al-Jura, all depopulated villages and towns taken over by Israel in 1948. Whenever I met someone from Beit Daras, we’d share memories, and laugh a lot, talking about the maftoul (Palestinian couscous) the town was famous for. The visit was light-hearted, filled with laughter and nostalgia, despite these people having been forced into camp life after the occupation drove them from their towns in horrific ways. I began to understand those Nakba stories more deeply when my grandfather began to tell me his own story. He became the central character in my Nakba reports every year, until his death in 2021. He estimated he was about 15 years old at the time. He was already married to my grandmother, and they had a child. He would describe the scenes as I sat in awe, asking myself: How could the world have stood by silently? My grandfather told me they had a good life, working their farm, eating from their crops. Each town had a specialty, and they exchanged produce. Theirs was a simple cuisine, with lots of lentils and bread made from wheat they ground in stone mills. Until that dreadful displacement. He said the Zionist militias forced them to leave, ordering them to go to nearby Gaza. My grandfather said he shut the door to his home, took my grandmother and their son – just a few months old – and started walking. Israeli planes hovered overhead, firing at people as if to drive them to move faster. The baby – my uncle – didn’t survive the journey. My grandfather never wanted to go into the details, he would only say that their son died from the conditions as they fled. After hours of walking, they reached Khan Younis and, with nowhere else to go, he pitched a tent. Eventually, UNRWA was set up and gave him a home, the one I remember from my childhood. It was so old; I spent years visiting them in that asbestos-roofed house with its aged walls. That memory of being forced into exile became their wound. Yet, the idea of return, the right to go home, was passed down through generations. The Nakba was a memory passed down from the elderly to the young. But in the war that Israel began waging on Gaza on October 7, 2023, we lived the Nakba. We were forcibly displaced under threat of weapons and air strikes. We saw our loved ones arrested before our eyes and tortured in prisons. We lived in tents and searched everywhere for basic provisions to save our children. My grandfather told me they fled under threat of weapons and planes – so did we. He said they searched for flour, food, and water while trying to protect their children – so are we, right now in the 21st century. Perhaps in 1948, the media was more primitive. But now, the world watches what’s happening in Gaza in many formats – written, visual, and audio – and yet, nothing has changed. Never did I imagine I’d live through an existential war – a war that threatens my very presence on my land, just as my grandparents lived through. The repeated scenes of displacement are so painful. They’re a cycle, one that we have been cursed to live through as Palestinians again and again. Will history record this as Nakba 2023? Years from now, will we speak of this Nakba just as we’ve spoken about the original one for 77 years? Will we tell stories, hold commemorations, and hold close memories of the dream of return that has stayed with us since childhood? Since I realised what it meant to be called a refugee and learned I had a homeland, I’ve been dreaming of returning. This pain, we can never forget it. I still remember the camp and my life there. I’ll never forget the moment Israel destroyed my house and made us homeless for two years, 24 years ago. Now we live our painful days searching for safety, fighting to survive. We will tell future generations about this war, the war of existence. We resist hunger, fear, thirst, and pain so we can remain on this land. The Nakba hasn’t ended. The 1948 Nakba continues in 2025.             Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/15/gaza-nakba-relived-2025"
"features","‘They’ll be back’: White Afrikaners leave South Africa to be refugees in US","15 May 2025","Qaanitah Hunter","Trump administration welcomes first batch of white Afrikaners while US cuts off refugee programmes to other countries. Johannesburg, South Africa – On a chilly Sunday evening in Johannesburg, OR Tambo International Airport was filled with tourists and travellers entering and exiting South Africa’s busiest airport. On one side of the international departures hall, a few dozen people queued – their trollies piled with luggage, travel pillows and children’s blankets – as they waited to board a charter flight to Washington Dulles International Airport in the United States. Dressed casually and comfortably for the 13-hour journey that would follow, the group – most young, all white – talked among themselves while avoiding onlookers. Although they blended into the bustling terminal around them, these weren’t ordinary travellers. They were Afrikaners leaving South Africa to be refugees in Donald Trump’s America. When Charl Kleinhaus first applied for refugee resettlement in the US earlier this year, he told officials he had been threatened and that people attempted to claim his property. The 46-year-old, who claimed to own a farm in Limpopo, South Africa’s northernmost province, was not required to present proof of these threats or provide details regarding when the alleged incidents occurred. On Sunday, he joined dozens of others accepted by the Trump administration as part of a pilot programme granting asylum to people from the Afrikaner community – descendants of mainly Dutch colonisers that led the brutal apartheid regime for nearly five decades. The Trump administration claims white people face discrimination in South Africa – a country where they make up some 7 percent of the population but own more than 70 percent of the land and occupy the majority of top management positions. “I want you all to know that you are really welcome here and that we respect what you have had to deal with these last few years,” US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau told Kleinhaus and the others when they landed at the Dulles International in Virginia. “We respect the long tradition of your people and what you have accomplished over the years,” he said on Monday. Speaking to a journalist at the airport, Kleinhaus said he never expected “this land expropriation thing to go so far” in South Africa. He was referring to the recently passed Expropriation Act, which allows the South African government to, in exceptional circumstances, take land for public use without compensation. Pretoria says the measure is aimed at redressing apartheid injustices, as Black South Africans who make up more than 80 percent of the population still own just 4 percent of the land. South African officials say the law has not resulted in any land grabs. There is also no record of Kleinhaus’s property being expropriated. Kleinhaus was unaffected by any threats and the government was unaware of anyone who might have threatened his property, Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told Al Jazeera. “The people of South Africa have not been affected by the expropriation of land. There’s no evidence. None of them are affected by any farm murders either,” the minister emphasised. In February, when Trump signed an executive order granting refugee status to Afrikaners, he cited widely discredited claims that their land was being seized and that they were being brutally killed in South Africa. On Monday, Trump again claimed that Afrikaners were victims of a “genocide” – an accusation South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and other experts maintain is based on lies. “Farmers are being killed,” Trump told reporters. “White farmers are being brutally killed, and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.” Ramaphosa has also debunked claims that the group who left this week faced any persecution at home. “They are leaving because they do not wish to embrace the democratic transformation unfolding in South Africa,” he said. For 60-year-old Sam Busa, watching Kleinhaus and the 48 other South Africans leave to be resettled in the US was a hopeful moment. Busa, who has also applied for asylum, is waiting in anticipation for an interview that would qualify her for resettlement. She has begun selling excess household items in anticipation of her new life in the US. The semi-retired businesswoman has been at the forefront of efforts – through a website called Amerikaners – encouraging Afrikaners to take an interest in the US offer to grant refugee status on the grounds that they face racial persecution in South Africa. When asked how she has experienced persecution because of her race, Busa recounted an incident where she was held at gunpoint at her home in Johannesburg – the commercial capital of South Africa and one of the most dangerous cities in the world. She later moved to KwaZulu-Natal on the country’s east coast, where she ran a business that provided services to the government. When asked whether she believed she was targeted because of her race or if she was simply a victim of common crime, Busa asserted it did not matter. She didn’t feel safe, she said. “I am not overly sensitive. When I watch Julius Malema singing about killing the Boer, it is extremely terrifying.” Malema, the far-left leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) political party, often sings a famous anti-apartheid song, Kill the Boer (Boer meaning farmer in Afrikaans), which the courts have ruled is not hate speech or an incitement to violence. For Busa, much like Kleinhaus, new legislation passed to bolster racial transformation, which includes having specific hiring targets for employment equity, has been “the straw that broke the camel’s back”. “Expropriation without compensation is a huge issue, along with the amendment to employment equity,” she said, restating her belief that white people don’t have a future in South Africa. “It’s coming hard and fast, and it’s becoming clear to [white] South Africans that we struggle with fears of home invasion. I don’t live on a farm, but there are massive fears because of the constant threat of crime. It has become clear to white South Africans; it’s not disguised,” she claimed. The narrative of fear is prevalent among those engaged in the refugee programme despite the fact that several experts have debunked the assertion that they were victims of racially motivated attacks and not common crime. South Africa sees about 19,000 murders a year. According to data from the police, most victims of rural crime are Black, with evidence showing that white farmers are not disproportionately being killed. Meanwhile, many participants in the US’s Afrikaner refugee resettlement programme do not even live on farms; many are urban dwellers, according to Minister Ntshavheni. Katia Beedan, who lives in Cape Town, is also anticipating resettlement in the US. She told Al Jazeera that refugee hopefuls do not have to prove racial persecution but simply articulate it. “For me, it’s racial persecution and political persecution,” she said about her reasons for wanting to leave South Africa. The copywriter-turned-life coach pointed to racial transformation laws targeting employment equity and land expropriation, which she believes the government is “overwhelming us with”, as a key reason for her desire to flee. However, many other South Africans see sections of the Afrikaner community – including their right-wing lobby groups like AfriForum that first pushed the false narrative of a “white genocide” – as struggling to exist equally in a country where they were once considered superior because of their race. “I think AfriForum is struggling with the reality of being ordinary,” social justice activist and South Africa’s former public protector, Thuli Madonsela, told local TV channel, Newzroom Afrika, in March. “The new South Africa requires all of us to be ordinary, whereas colonialism and apartheid made white people special people. “I think some white people … [are] seeking to reverse the wheel and find reason to be special again. They seem to have found an ally in the American president,” she said. In February, as Trump expedited efforts to resettle Afrikaners in the US, he was closing off his country’s refugee programme to other asylum seekers from war-torn and famine-stricken parts of the world. For Loren Landau from the African Centre for Migration and Society at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, the Afrikaner refugee relocation is “absurd and ridiculous”. “They have not been welcomed as tourists or work permit holders, but as refugees. The idea of a refugee system is to protect those who cannot be safeguarded by their own states and who fear persecution or violence because of who they are or their membership in a social group. Can Afrikaners make that case?” he asked. Although “there are people in South Africa who discriminate against them,” and Afrikaners now “have less privilege and protection than during the apartheid era”, it cannot be said that this is indicative of state policy, he said, adding that many different people are robbed, killed, and face discrimination in South Africa. “Are they [Afrikaners] specially victimised because of who they are? Absolutely not!” Landau added. He said all statistics on land ownership, income, and education levels indicate that South Africa’s white population far outstrips others: “They are still by far in the top strata of South African society. No one is taking their land. No one is taking their cars.” Even fringe groups that may have called for land grabs have done little to enact their threats, observers note. However, for Busa, that doesn’t matter. “I fear for my children. You never know when the EFF decides they want you dead. It’s not a country I want to live in,” she said. The EFF has said those who decide to leave South Africa should have their citizenship revoked. Confronted with the implications of this situation, the government is considering whether those who exit as refugees could easily return to the country. Ramaphosa is expected to discuss the ongoing matter with Trump at a meeting in the US next week. Meanwhile, for the Afrikaners now in the US, most will settle in Texas, with others in New York, Idaho, Iowa and North Carolina, while the government helps them find work and accommodation. They will hold refugee status for one year, after which they can apply for a US green card to make them permanent residents. At the same time, the Afrikaner resettlement programme remains open to others who want to apply. When Kleinhaus and his group arrived in the US on Monday, they had smiles on their faces as they met officials and waved US flags. Yet, for South Africa’s president, their resettlement in the US marks “a sad moment for them” – and something he believes may not last. “As South Africans, we are resilient. We don’t run away from our problems,” he said at an agricultural exhibition in Free State province on Monday. “If you look at all national groups in our country, Black and white, they’ve stayed in this country because it’s our country. “I can bet you that they [the Afrikaners who left] will be back soon because there is no country like South Africa.”             Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/15/theyll-be-back-white-afrikaners-leave-south-africa-to-be-refugees-in-us"
"features","Russia grabs a bit more of Ukraine as it heads into peace talks","15 May 2025","John T Psaropoulos","On eve of Istanbul peace talks, Moscow ignored a US-EU call for a 30-day ceasefire and showed signs of preparing for new offensives. Russian forces made creeping advances through Ukraine’s east this week, as the two countries prepared to hold their first direct talks in three years on Thursday. Russian forces captured the settlement of Kotlyarivka, southwest of the embattled area of Pokrovsk, on Monday, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said.     The seizure brought Russian forces to within 3.7km (2.3 miles) of the regional border between Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk in Ukraine. Russian forces also forced their way into the village of Myrolyubivka, east of Pokrovsk, and claimed to have taken the entire settlement. On Wednesday, Russia’s Defence Ministry claimed its forces took the community of Mykhailovka, also in Donetsk. These were minor advances, but showed there was no letup in Russia’s effort to take all of Donetsk and other regions it partly occupies, even as it prepared to go into peace talks. According to Ukrainian military intelligence, Russia was even moving troops into position for a major new offensive, the United Kingdom’s Financial Times reported. US President Donald Trump called for a 30-day ceasefire on May 8. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, flanked by the leaders of Poland, Germany, France and Britain, backed that demand on Saturday. Despite telling Western reporters Russia would “think about that”, the Kremlin ended up insisting on peace talks without a ceasefire, accusing Ukraine of violating previous ceasefires it announced unilaterally. Instead, Putin proposed peace talks without conditions at a dawn media conference on Sunday. “We are not ruling out that during these talks we will be able to agree on some new ceasefire, a new truce,” he said. Zelenskyy has said he would attend the talks in Istanbul if Putin does as well. Putin was expected after his spokesman said Russia would attend “at the corresponding” level, but then his name did not appear on a list of delegates Russia provided. “If Putin does not show up – if this is another game – it will clearly demonstrate that Russia is not ready to end the war,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media, calling for a new sanctions package in that case. As of Wednesday night, he was saying: “I am waiting to see who will come from Russia, and then I will decide which steps Ukraine should take.” US President Donald Trump, currently on a Middle East tour, is claiming credit for this diplomatic initiative. “I insisted that that meeting take place and it is taking place,” he said. Trump dispatched his Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and said he “was thinking of actually flying over. There’s a possibility of it, I guess, if I think things can happen.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will host the talks. “I think we have a window of opportunity this week and in the next 10 days – two weeks – to bring the issue of Ukraine to a more constructive level,” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told Turkiye’s Anadolu news agency. There appeared to be a connection between Putin’s meetings with foreign leaders on Saturday, and his peace talks proposal at dawn on Sunday. At 1:30am [22:30 GMT] on Sunday morning, he was still in talks with the leader of South Ossetia, a breakaway region of Georgia. It was the last of four days of meetings with 23 leaders who came to Moscow for the May 9 parade to celebrate the end of the second world war. At 4am [01:00 GMT], he alerted the media that he would announce “the results of international events to mark the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany”. When he invited Ukraine to peace talks in Turkiye less than two hours later, he also thanked foreign partners for their “peace-oriented efforts”, Kremlin newswire TASS reported. Zelenskyy said Ukraine had received a message of support for its call for a 30-day ceasefire from China, perhaps a sign that China privately put pressure on Putin to pursue peace. There were strong headwinds going into the talks, however. Putin’s language when announcing the talks was not friendly. “The ball is now in the court of the Kyiv government and its curators, who are guided by political ambitions – not their people’s interests – in their desire to continue the conflict with Russia with the hands of Ukrainian nationalists,” he said, a reference to European governments, which have been less keen than the Trump administration to push Ukraine into talks. Russia is taking a hard line going in. On Tuesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Russia would insist on the “denazification of the Kyiv regime”, Moscow’s way of describing Zelenskyy’s removal from office, and recognition of “current realities on the ground” – ie, there will be no territorial concessions. On Tuesday, almost on the eve of talks in Istanbul on Thursday, Putin was selling Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine to investors at the Delovaya Rossiya (Business Russia) association, implying there would be no territorial concessions. “There is something to invest in there. There are such lands, fertile in terms of agriculture and favourable in terms of tourism development,” he said. On Wednesday, Russian ambassador-at-large Rodion Miroshnik told reporters that negotiations need not go further than the Istanbul proposals of 2022. That was when Russia attempted to impose a capitulation agreement in March and April of 2022, when a Russian invasion force threatened to take Kyiv. It named Russia and China as Ukraine’s security guarantors, cut down Ukraine’s armed forces to 85,000 personnel, less than one-tenth of the current Ukrainian army, and forbade Ukraine from joining foreign alliances such as NATO. “Let’s go back, make adjustments to it that have emerged over the past three years and after that we will move to signing this document,” Miroshnik said. The Western position ahead of talks has also been hard on Russia. On the day of Putin’s parade, some 40 world leaders gathered in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv to celebrate the end of World War II and announced a tribunal to try Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The tribunal was to be launched in Luxembourg this week, when the Council of Europe was to convene. On Tuesday, the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization officially held Russia responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014. Pro-Russian separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine used a Russian Buk air defence system to down the plane in July that year, killing all 298 people on board. On Wednesday this week, the European Union agreed on a 17th sanctions package restricting 200 tankers used by Russia to evade a ban on its oil exports to the EU, bringing Moscow tens of billions in illicit dollars. EU foreign ministers are expected to put the sanctions into force on May 20. European commissioner for economic affairs Valdis Dombrovskis said work would begin immediately on an 18th package. On Monday, Poland shut down Russia’s consulate in Krakow, after investigators determined that a fire that destroyed the Marywilska shopping centre last year was the work of Russian saboteurs.

Long before lines were drawn on a map and city names were changed, there existed a land full of people who lived in bustling cities and remote villages, where markets overflowed with diverse voices, and farmers tended olive trees rooted deep in the hills. This story is told not through treaties or timelines, but through photographs: small, powerful fragments that capture the texture of daily life and those who lived it. They offer a rare, unfiltered lens into the lived reality of Palestinians in a time before exile and occupation dominated the narrative. This collection of 100 archived images of life in Palestine before the 1948 Nakba, when Zionist militias expelled at least 750,000 Palestinians and captured 78 percent of historical Palestine. Browse through Palestine as it was: people, places, and life and culture. The children, elders, farmers and merchants At the heart of any place is its people. This section gathers faces and figures of children, elders, farmers and merchants, capturing a moment in each of their lives. Traditional dress, expressions and gestures reflect a culture rich in diversity. Muslims, Christians, Jews, and Bedouins appear side by side, revealing a land defined not by division, but by coexistence. Each face carries its own story of life, labour, joy, or longing.

From the old stone quarters of Jerusalem to the hills of the Galilee, each image in this chapter grounds us in lived-in spaces carrying memory and meaning. From the bustling port of Jaffa to the stone alleys of Hebron, towns in Palestine bear layers of history.  Minarets, domes and arches stood as testaments to faith, craft and endurance.  Narrow alleys and open markets were arteries of daily life. Here, footsteps, voices, and trade converged in constant motion.  The rhythm of the everyday Here, we see how people moved, worked, gathered and celebrated. Carts on dusty roads, bread baking in clay ovens, weddings, markets and moments of rest. In kitchens and courtyards, daily rituals - grinding beans, sieving wheat and baking bread - played out with grace.  From weddings and blessings to public festivals and pilgrimages, communal life pulsed with joy and meaning, be it sharing lunch or walking in a bridal procession.  Work in olive groves, workshops and coastal waters was both a necessity and an art. These photographs honour the makers, menders, and growers who shaped Palestine through skill and perseverance.

"features","What does the PKK’s disarming mean for its regional allies?","14 May 2025","Justin Salhani","Syria’s SDF is unlikely to follow the PKK’s lead and disarm, but talks with Damascus could be bolstered. When Abdullah Ocalan said his Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, should lay down its arms and disband after more than four decades of conflict with the Turkish state and tens of thousands of deaths, there was an instant look across the border to Syria. Syria’s northeast is largely controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led military force Turkiye has repeatedly fought against over the past decade. The SDF is led by the People’s Protection Units (YPG), which Turkiye views as a “terrorist” group and the Syrian branch of the PKK. The United States, however, has backed the YPG in Syria to fight against ISIL (ISIS). Since the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, the SDF has been negotiating with the new Turkish-allied government in Damascus over what its future role in a newly unified Syria and as a military force will be and what kind of governance will extend to the northeast of the country. The removal of the PKK from the equation will likely facilitate the SDF’s integration with Damascus, analysts told Al Jazeera. “For the SDF, it makes it much easier to talk with the government in Damascus and also to de-escalate their relations with Turkey,” said Wladimir van Wilgenburg, an analyst of Kurdish politics based in Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq. While the SDF rejects Turkiye’s assertions that it is the Syrian arm of the PKK, analysts said the groups have strong links. While the PKK’s announcement that it would heed Ocalan’s call and disarm was welcomed by SDF leader Mazloum Abdi, he said his group would not disarm and Ocalan’s decision did not extend to Syria. But this could give the group further incentives to bring its fighting force and governing structure – called the Autonomous Administration in North and East Syria (AANES) – under the umbrella of the new government in Damascus. When reached for comment on Monday, an AANES spokesperson told Al Jazeera: “The autonomous administration is not concerned with the internal affairs of other countries.” The SDF has clashed with Turkish-backed Syrian factions, including in the immediate days after the fall of al-Assad’s regime, and sustained attacks from Turkiye’s air force. In December, the US negotiated a ceasefire between the SDF and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, which has since been incorporated into Syria’s new armed forces. Abdi has been in discussions with the new Syrian government, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, over how best to integrate the SDF into the post-Baathist Party security forces and govern Syria’s northeast.    The SDF has engaged in the talks with the pressure of an impending US troop withdrawal from northeast Syria. Without a US presence and support, the SDF has feared it might be vulnerable to attacks from Turkiye or Turkish-backed factions in Syria. But should the PKK’s decision to disarm bring a feeling of security to Turkiye along its border with Syria, analysts said the relations between the SDF and Turkiye would also likely improve. “We know that Turkey’s hardline stance towards the SDF was very much linked to concerns over the PKK and not so much about the SDF being Kurdish-dominated,” Thomas Pierret, a Syria specialist and senior researcher at the Institute of Research and Study on the Arab and Islamic Worlds, told Al Jazeera. This is evident by Turkiye’s relations with Masoud Barzani and his Kurdish Democratic Party in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region, Pierret said. Of course, this new reality “doesn’t mean it will be easy”, according to Pierret. Under the agreement between Turkiye and the PKK, some fighters could be relocated to third countries – essentially sent into exile. There’s also the possibility some fighters may decide to make their way to northeast Syria, in which case, Pierret said, Turkiye could see the SDF as a haven for PKK fighters. So Turkiye will keep a close eye on the SDF in Syria and the SDF’s negotiations with Damascus. In the past, the Turkish military has launched drones, fired artillery and carried out air strikes against Kurdish fighters, including the SDF.  And analysts said military options may still be on the table going forward. “For now, they seem to be letting negotiations take their course,” Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International with a focus on Syria, told Al Jazeera. “And that’s probably related both to events in Syria but also to the PKK process.”    The PKK’s affiliates and allies are spread across regions of the Middle East where Kurds live. Historically, the PKK has operated in Turkiye as well as northern Iraq. And their allies have operated in places where Kurds live in Syria and Iran. Their struggles have often opposed the national authorities in those places or sought self-determination or federalism. One example is the Kurdistan Free Life Party, or PJAK, in Iran, which says its goal is to declare an autonomous Kurdish region in Iran. “It’s unclear what will happen with the … PJAK because they also have a number of Iranian Kurdish fighters inside the PKK,” van Wildenburg said. “It’s possible that they will continue as a political party and not as an armed group because they are already not doing much fighting against the Iranian state anyway.” Analysts agree it is unclear whether the PKK’s allies will follow Ocalan’s lead and lay down their arms or, as is the case with the SDF in Syria, if they will view their own struggles as independent and make decisions on their own.

"features","Writing the wrongs","14 May 2025","Noel Ransome","Novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen weighs the costs of speaking against injustice In a theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen readied himself to speak. It was December 2023, and Nguyen was midway through a six-part lecture series at Harvard University. But the remarks he had originally drafted months earlier, during the summer, had begun to feel stale. Something more recent was weighing on his mind: Israel's war on Gaza. Since the war began that October, Nguyen had watched coverage showing Palestinian families erased overnight, neighbourhoods levelled to dust and starvation wielded as a weapon. But he had also felt the sting of public backlash for speaking out. Criticism of the war was often accompanied by accusations of anti-Semitism or indifference to the suffering of captives held in Gaza by the armed group Hamas. For artists like Nguyen, the consequences could be lost contracts and cancelled gigs. Nguyen had already seen his scheduled talk at New York’s 92nd Street Y — a major cultural institution in the United States — abruptly paused after he signed a letter denouncing the violence in Gaza. As he prepared to resume the podium at Harvard, he faced a choice: to confront what he saw as a present-day injustice — and accept the pushback — or avoid the subject entirely. He decided to do what he felt was uncomfortable, but necessary. ""It’s easy to talk about darkness in history,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""But are we willing to confront what’s happening right now, right in front of our faces, in Palestine?""  That lecture series became the basis for Nguyen's latest book, To Save and to Destroy, released in the US last month. In its pages, Nguyen — the winner of a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, one of the country's highest literary honours — lays out the argument that writers are never neutral. They are entangled in the very systems they seek to portray. Merging memoir, criticism and political reflection, it is a book preoccupied with power: who holds it, who resists it and what is at stake when artists dare to speak freely. Nguyen knows this terrain firsthand. After all, the currents of international power have shaped his life, starting from an early age. Born in 1971, in the midst of the Vietnam War, Nguyen was only four years old when the North Vietnamese forces made their final push to secure their grip on the country. Faced with soldiers sweeping south, Nguyen, his mother and his older brother fled their hometown of Buôn Ma Thuột by foot. On a boat to Saigon, they were reunited with Nguyen's father and began their journey to the US as refugees. Confronting the history and politics of that era has been a defining theme in his work. The Sympathizer — his Pulitzer-winning debut — explores the fractured identities and divided loyalties of a spy in the aftermath of the war. His nonfiction, including Nothing Ever Dies, offers a lens on how memories of wartime can be warped and manipulated. “War, memory, identity — that triangle made me American,” Nguyen told Al Jazeera. While some prize escapism in literature, Nguyen finds inspiration in confronting the thorniness of politics. His work has earned him several prestigious awards, ranging from the Guggenheim Fellowship to the MacArthur ""genius grant"". ""The idea that art is political isn’t a deformation of art. It’s a fulfilment of it,"" he said.  But the political climate surrounding the war in Gaza has presented new challenges for Nguyen and other writers. As far back as 2016, Nguyen had expressed support for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), a nonviolent protest movement against Israel to support Palestinian rights. In October 2023, he signed an open letter published in the London Review of Books, alongside more than 750 other writers, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and condemning Israel’s military actions. But the fallout was swift. The cancellation of his talk at the 92nd Street Y sparked national media attention and intense public debate. ""I hope there is a moral consensus that killing civilians is wrong, whether Hamas does it or whether Israel does it,"" he wrote in response on social media. Still, some commenters criticised him for claiming a ""moral equivalence"" between the two sides. Nguyen underscored that his platform is not a shield: He still faces backlash to his work. ""People simply don't talk to me any more, people have thrown me out of their circles, or I've lost invitations to things,"" he said. Still, he acknowledged that his standing in the literary community has helped make the ""price"" of his choices ""manageable"". ""I speak from a position of privilege,"" he said. ""My titles, my professional status — maybe they protect me a little."" Other writers, he added, are more vulnerable, and the consequences of speaking out can be more severe.  In May 2021, for instance, a 22-year-old Associated Press staffer, Emily Wilder, was fired after right-wing media resurfaced pro-Palestinian statements she made while in college. More recently, in March, the administration of President Donald Trump detained Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student studying at Tufts University, and stripped her of her visa. Her supporters say she did little more than co-write an op-ed critical of the university's refusal to ""acknowledge the Palestinian genocide"". Though she has been released from government custody, she continues to face deportation proceedings. One culture writer and critic, speaking to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, explained that he fears that speaking out on issues like the war in Gaza could jeopardise his work visa status in the US. In addition to his work as a writer, he has a background in film and television, having taken on roles as a director, screenwriter and editor for several international projects. ""In the last couple of months, I’ve felt this overwhelming guilt, like I’m choosing my own safety over speaking out. It’s the first time I’ve really felt that way,"" he said. ""I’ve done a couple of on-camera interviews for the BBC, where I wore a Palestinian keffiyeh and was very outspoken. But I don’t see myself doing that in the near future."" He added that he has friends with green cards who were unexpectedly interrogated upon re-entering the US, despite their status as permanent residents. ""After Trump’s re-election, I told myself, 'This time, I’m not going to stay angry and frustrated. I’m just going to put my head down and keep moving forward,'"" he said. Celine Parreñas Shimizu, the dean of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, believes voices like Nguyen's can help break the silence that results from such crackdowns and threats. ""Critical acclaim"", she explained, ""enables creativity in response to the forces that seek to silence us"". But she, too, warned that no amount of accolades could fully protect an author from damage to their reputation or lost opportunities. ""Critical or professional acclaim offers no true shield against racism's fundamental dehumanisation,"" Parreñas Shimizu said.  The pressures on young, emerging writers weigh heavily on Nguyen, who has witnessed similar struggles among his students at the University of Southern California. ""Young writers here, they’re like writers everywhere. They’re afraid of not getting published. They’re afraid of not having a life in the audience,"" Nguyen said. Those fears can lead to life-altering decisions, Nguyen explained. ""I’ve had a writer who is trans. They left the US a few weeks ago, terrified, and removed themselves to another country."" When he talks to his students, he emphasises the time and difficulty involved in pursuing a career in writing, no matter the circumstances. ""What I try to do with those writers is impress upon them that it took 30 years of misery to get to where I am. Every writer is alone. You have to cultivate discipline within yourself to confront that solitude."" But even so, those closest to Nguyen wonder about the toll his writing and public activism can take. Thi Bui, a cartoonist, first bonded with Nguyen during a writers' residency run by the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network (DVAN). They have collaborated on a children's book in the years since. Bui told Al Jazeera that she admires the way Nguyen takes on each of his roles — writer, activist, father — with equal strength. ""He takes things head-on,"" she said. ""He channels his anger into writing fast."" But she has also noticed the pressure he faces for speaking out, even at times when silence might be easier. ""He’s always carrying more than he lets on,"" Bui said. ""Even when he’s joking or smiling, you can feel the heaviness behind it. I sometimes worry about that. As much as he works on the world, there’s always a lot of trauma he’s had to grapple with."" But for Nguyen, speaking out is part of his cultural framework — an inextricable part of himself. ""I grew up Catholic. Pope Francis just died, and I’ve been thinking about him,"" he said. ""That tradition taught me about justice — not as a slogan, but something spiritual. Jesus was a truth-teller. That mattered."" His writing, he says, is tied to that spiritual inheritance. ""I carry that obligation with me.""

"economy","China’s industrial output, retail sales dip amid US trade tensions","19 May 2025",NA,"Despite slowdown, data points to reliance of Chinese economy in the face of Donald Trump’s tariffs. China’s industrial output and retail sales growth have slowed amid trade tensions with the United States. Factory output grew 6.1 percent year-on-year in April, down from a 7.7 percent rise in March, data released by China’s National Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday. While down compared with the previous month, the figure beat analysts’ expectations. Analysts polled by the Reuters and Bloomberg news agencies had respectively forecast growth of 5.5 percent and 5.7 percent. Retail sales grew 5.1 percent year-on-year, slower than the 5.9 percent growth recorded in March and below analysts’ forecasts. Fixed-asset investment, which includes property and infrastructure investment, rose 4 percent. Unemployment fell slightly, from 5.2 percent to 5.1 percent. The latest data is likely to bolster hopes of China’s economy remaining resilient in the face of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, after gross domestic product expanded a better-than-expected 5.4 percent in the January-March period. The National Bureau of Statistics said the economy maintained “new and positive development momentum” due to Beijing’s economic policies, despite the “increasing impact of external shocks”. “However, we should be aware that there are still many unstable and uncertain factors in external environment, and the foundation for sustained economic recovery needs to be further consolidated,” the statistics agency said in a statement. The economic figures are the first to be released since Washington and Beijing last week agreed to dramatically reduce tariffs on each other’s goods for 90 days. Under the deal reached in Geneva, the US lowered its tariff on Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China slashed its rate from 125 percent to 10 percent. “The risk is that tariffs remain in place for a long time, and eventually, we see production offshored,” Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said in a note on Monday. “But amid tariff unpredictability, not just for China but across the world, few companies will be rushing to commit resources to set up offshore manufacturing facilities. This could mean that a decent portion of China’s manufacturing and exports will be less impacted than originally feared.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/5/19/chinas-industrial-output-retail-sales-dip-amid-us-trade-tensions"
"economy","Moody’s strips US government of top credit rating","16 May 2025",NA,"Moody’s cited rising debt, saying US had repeatedly failed to end the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and interest. Moody’s Ratings has stripped the United States government of its top credit rating, citing successive governments’ failure to stop a rising tide of debt, a surprise move that could complicate President Donald Trump’s efforts to cut taxes and send ripples through global markets. On Friday, Moody’s lowered the rating from a gold-standard Aaa to Aa1. “Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” it said as it changed its outlook on the US to “stable” from “negative”. But, it added, the US “retains exceptional credit strengths such as the size, resilience and dynamism of its economy and the role of the US dollar as global reserve currency.” Moody’s is the last of the three major rating agencies to lower the federal government’s credit rating. Standard & Poor’s downgraded federal debt in 2011, and Fitch Ratings followed in 2023. In a statement, Moody’s said, “We expect federal deficits to widen, reaching nearly 9 percent of [the US economy] by 2035, up from 6.4 percent in 2024, driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation.’’ Extending President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, a priority of the Republican-controlled Congress, Moody’s said, would add $4 trillion over the next decade to the federal primary deficit, which does not include interest payments. White House communications director Steven Cheung reacted to the downgrade via a social media post, singling out Moody’s economist, Mark Zandi, for criticism. He called Zandi a political opponent of Trump. “Nobody takes his ‘analysis’ seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,” Cheung said. Stephen Moore, former senior economic adviser to Trump and an economist at Heritage Foundation, called the move “outrageous”. “If a US-backed government bond isn’t triple A-asset, then what is?” he told Reuters. The Department of the Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency.    A gridlocked political system has been unable to tackle the huge deficits that the US has accumulated. Republicans reject tax increases, and Democrats are reluctant to cut spending. On Friday, House Republicans failed to push a big package of tax breaks and spending cuts through the Budget Committee. A small group of hard-right Republican lawmakers, insisting on steeper cuts to Medicaid and President Joe Biden’s green energy tax breaks, joined all Democrats in opposing it – a rare political setback for the Republican president. Since his return to the White House on January 20, Trump has said he would balance the budget while his Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has repeatedly said the current administration aims to lower US government funding costs. Trump’s attempts to cut spending through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have fallen far short of its initial goals. And attempts to raise revenue through tariffs have sparked concerns about a trade war and global slowdown, roiling markets. Left unchecked, such worries could trigger a bond market rout and hinder the administration’s ability to pursue its agenda. The downgrade, which came after market close, sent yields on Treasury bonds higher, and analysts said it could give investors a pause when markets re-open for regular trading on Monday. “Very surprising. This is big – markets were not expecting this at all,” said Tom di Galoma, managing director of rates and trading at Mischler Financial in Utah.

"economy","World Bank says Syria eligible for new loans after debts cleared","16 May 2025",NA,"Saudi and Qatari payments settle Syria’s arrears, allowing World Bank and IMF to re-engage. The World Bank says it will restart operations in Syria following a 14-year pause after the country cleared more than $15m of debt with financial backing from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The United States-based institution announced on Friday that Syria no longer has outstanding obligations to the International Development Association (IDA), its fund dedicated to low-income countries. Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia and Qatar paid off Syria’s outstanding debts of approximately $15.5m, paving the way for renewed engagement with international financial bodies. “We are pleased that the clearance of Syria’s arrears will allow the World Bank Group to reengage with the country and address the development needs of the Syrian people,” the bank said. “After years of conflict, Syria is on a path to recovery and development.” The bank is now preparing its first project in Syria, which will focus on improving electricity access — a key pillar for revitalising essential services like healthcare, education, and water supply. Officials said it marks the beginning of expanded support aimed at stabilising Syria and boosting long-term growth. The bank’s announcement coincides with a dramatic shift in US policy towards Damascus. US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that Washington would begin lifting sanctions imposed on Syria, including measures under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. On Wednesday, Trump met Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa on the sidelines of the GCC summit in Riyadh, marking a historic breakthrough in relations between the countries and the first such meeting between the two nations’ leaders in 25 years. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that waivers would be issued, easing restrictions on entities previously penalised for dealings with the now former administration of Bashar al-Assad, which was toppled in December. “Lifting sanctions on Syria represents a fundamental turning point,” Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist and banking expert, told Al Jazeera. “The Syrian economy will transition from interacting with developing economies to integrating with more developed ones, potentially significantly reshaping trade and investment relations.” The moves represent a significant moment in Syria’s reintegration into the global financial system after 13 years of civil war and isolation. In April, a rare meeting was held in Washington involving officials from Syria, the IMF, the World Bank, and Saudi Arabia. A joint statement issued afterwards acknowledged the dire state of Syria’s economy and promised coordinated efforts to support its recovery. The International Monetary Fund has since named its first mission chief to Syria in more than a decade. Ron van Rooden, previously involved with IMF operations in Ukraine, will lead the Fund’s renewed engagement.    Martin Muehleisen, a former IMF strategy chief, noted the urgency of providing technical assistance to rebuild Syria’s financial institutions. “Those efforts could be funded by donors and grants in-kind,” he told the news agency Reuters, adding that some support could begin within months. Al-Assad was toppled after a lightning offensive by opposition fighters led by the Hay’et Tahrir al-Sham armed group last December. Syria’s new government has sought to rebuild the country’s diplomatic ties, including with international financial institutions. It also counts on wealthy Gulf Arab states to play a pivotal role in financing the reconstruction of Syria’s war-ravaged infrastructure and reviving its economy. The government, led by interim President al-Sharaa, also wants to transition away from the system that gave al-Assad loyalists privileged access to government contracts and kept key industries in the hands of the al-Assad family.

"economy","Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ at a crucial juncture","16 May 2025","Andy Hirschfeld","The bill proposes sweeping changes, including Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and enacting deep cuts to social programmes. United States House Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill”, a wide-ranging tax and spending legislation, is at a crucial moment. The nearly 400-page legislation proposes sweeping changes which include extending the 2017 tax cuts, slashing taxes for businesses and individuals, and enacting deep cuts to social programmes like Medicaid and SNAP. While Republicans tout the bill as a boon for economic growth and middle-class relief, nonpartisan analysts warn it could add trillions to the national debt and strip millions of Americans of medical and food assistance. The bill will be voted on by the House Budget Committee today and, if passed, will be voted on the floor next week. The most substantive part of the bill is an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. The tax bill would add at least an additional $2.5 trillion to the national deficit over the next 10 years and decrease federal tax revenue by roughly $4 trillion by 2034. Passing the legislation will also raise the debt ceiling, which sets the amount of money the government can borrow to pay for existing expenditures, by $4 trillion, a sticking point for hardline Republicans who want deeper cuts. Here are some of the key measures in the proposed bill in its current form. The bill increases standard deductions for all Americans. Individual deductions will increase by $1,000, $1,500 for heads of households, and $2,000 for married couples. The bill extends the child tax credit of $2,000, which would otherwise have ended with the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts at year’s end. It bumps up the child tax credit by $500 per child for this tax year and runs through the end of 2028. It also includes a $1,000 savings account for children born between December 31, 2024 and January 1, 2029. The legislation would also allow families to annually contribute $5,000 tax-free. There is a new tax deduction for Americans 65 and older. The new bill would give a $4,000 annual deduction starting this year for people making a gross income of $75,000 for a single person and $150,000 for a married couple. If passed, the rule would take effect for the current tax year and run until the end of 2028. “It will just make tax paying more complicated and more uncertain when a lot of these things ultimately expire,” Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute, told Al Jazeera.    Another provision in the bill modifies state and local tax (SALT) deductions. It allows filers to be able to write off some of what they paid in local and state taxes from their federal filings. Under the 2017 tax act, that was capped at $10,000, but the new legislation would raise that to $30,000. Some Republicans, particularly those in states with higher taxes like New York and California, have been pushing to raise the cap or abolish it altogether. However, they have faced fiscal hawks and those who see the increases as relief for those already wealthy. The bill includes an increased benefit for small businesses that allows them to deduct 23 percent of their qualified business income from their taxes, up from the current 20 percent. There is also a call for no taxes on overtime pay for select individuals. It would not apply to people who are non-citizens, those who are considered “highly compensated employees,” and those who earn a tipped wage. The bill, however, also eliminates taxes on tips, a critical campaign promise by both Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. The bill would allow people who work in sectors like food service, as well as hair care, nail care, aesthetics, and body and spa treatments, to specifically deduct the amount of tipped income they receive. At the federal level, employers will still not be required to pay tipped workers more than the subminimum wage of $2.13 hourly. The intention is that workers will be able to make up the difference in tipping the receipt from customers. The legislation calls to make $880bn in cuts to key government programmes with a focus mostly on Medicaid and food stamps. The CBO found that more than 10 million people could lose Medicaid access and 7.6 million could lose access to health insurance completely by 2034 under the current plan. Even far-right Republicans have called out the Medicaid cuts. In an op-ed in The New York Times this week, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said the cuts are “morally wrong and politically suicidal”. According to a new report from One Fair Wage shared with Al Jazeera, tipped workers could be hit especially hard, as 1.2 million restaurant and tipped workers could lose access to Medicaid. “A no tax on tips proposal, which is like a minuscule percentage of their income and doesn’t affect two-thirds of tips workers because they don’t earn enough to pay federal income tax, is just nowhere near enough to compensate for the fact that we’re going to have millions of these workers lose the ability to take care of themselves, in some cases go into medical debt, in many cases just not take care of themselves,” Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, an advocacy group for restaurant workers, told Al Jazeera. The bill also introduces work requirements to receive benefits, saying that recipients must prove they work, volunteer or are enrolled in school for at least 80 hours each month. At the same time, the bill also shortens the open enrolment period by a month for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare. This means people who have employer-funded healthcare and lose their job might lose eligibility to buy a private plan on the healthcare exchange. “It’s taking folks like 11 to 12 weeks to find a new job. The worse the labour market gets, that number will tick up. If you’re unemployed for three months, you get kicked off Medicaid,” Liz Pancotti, managing director of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, told Al Jazeera. “Then, if you try to go buy a plan on the ACA marketplace, you are no longer eligible for subsidies … which I think is really cruel.” Other major proposed cuts will hit programmes like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme or SNAP, which helps 42 million low-income individuals afford groceries and comes at a time when food costs are still 2 percent higher than a year ago. The CBO found that 3 million people could lose SNAP access under the new plan. The bill would also force states to take up more responsibility in funding the programmes. States would be required to cover 75 percent of the administrative costs, and all states would have to pay at least 5 percent of the benefits — 28 states would need to pay 25 percent. “States are now going to be on the hook for billions of dollars in funding for these two vital programmes. They have a tough choice. One is, do they cut funding from others like K-12 education, roads, veteran services, etc, to cover this gap, or do they raise taxes so that they can raise more revenue to cover this gap,” Pancotti added. Under the current law, the federal government is solely responsible for shouldering the cost of benefits. The proposed cuts would save $300bn for the federal government but hit state budgets hard. The bill would also cut the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicle purchases and $4,000 for a used EV, a move which could hurt several major US automakers that are already reeling from the administration’s tariffs on automobiles. General Motors pumped billions into domestic EV production in the last year, which has included a $900m investment to retrofit an existing plant to build electric vehicles in Michigan and alongside Samsung, the carmaker invested $3.5bn in EV battery manufacturing in the US. In February, Ford CEO Jim Farley said that revoking the EV tax credit could put factory jobs on the chopping block. The carmaker invested in three EV battery plants in Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee. The federal government under the administration of former President Joe Biden paid out more than $2bn in EV tax credits in 2024. The proposed legislation would also give the Trump administration authority to revoke the tax exempt status of nonprofit organisations that it deems as a “terrorist supporting organisation”. It would give the secretary of the treasury the ability to accuse any nonprofit of supporting “terrorism”, revoke their tax exempt status without allowing them due process to prove otherwise, which has raised serious concerns amongst critics. “This measure’s real intent lurks behind its hyperbolic and unsubstantiated anti-terrorist rhetoric: It would allow the Treasury Department to explicitly target, harass and investigate thousands of U.S. organizations that make up civil society, including nonprofit newsrooms,” Jenna Ruddock, advocacy director of Free Press Action, said in a statement. “The bill’s language lacks any meaningful safeguards against abuse. Instead it puts the burden of proof on organizations rather than on the government. It’s not hard to imagine how the Trump administration would use it to exact revenge on groups that have raised questions about or simply angered the president and other officials in his orbit.”    The bill would introduce new taxes on colleges, including a varying tax rate based on the size of a university’s endowment per student with the highest at 14 percent for universities with a per student endowment of more than $1.25m but less than $2m and 21 percent for those of $2m or more. This comes amid the Trump administration’s increased tensions with higher education. In the last week, the Trump administration pulled $450m in grants to Harvard on top of the $2.2bn it pulled in April — a move which will hinder research into cancer and heart disease, among other areas. Harvard has an endowment of $53.2bn, making it one of the richest schools in the country. The legislation would also increase funding for a border wall between the US and Mexico, which the administration has argued will help curb undocumented immigration. However, there is no evidence that such a wall has deterred border crossings. A 2018 analysis from Stanford University found that a border wall would only curb migration by 0.6 percent, yet the bill would give more than $50bn to finish the border wall and maritime crossings. The bill would also provide $45bn for building and maintaining detention facilities and another $14bn for transport.

"economy","Five key takeaways from US President Donald Trump’s Middle East trip","16 May 2025","Ali Harb","The president has secured massive investments deals, appeared to snub Israel and scolded neoconservative interventionists. Washington, DC – Three days, three countries, hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and a geopolitical shift in the United States’s approach to the region: Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East has been eventful. This week, the United States president visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the first planned trip of his second presidency, after attending Pope Francis’s funeral last month. Trump was visibly gleeful throughout the trip as he secured investments, criticised domestic political rivals and heaped praise on Gulf leaders. The word “historic” was used more than a few times by US officials to describe the visits. With Trump returning to the White House, here are five key takeaways from his trip: Addressing an investment summit in Riyadh, Trump promoted a realist approach to the Middle East — one in which the US does not intervene in the affairs of other countries. He took a swipe at neoconservatives who oversaw the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he lauded Gulf leaders for developing the region. “This great transformation has not come from Western intervention or flying people in beautiful planes, giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,” he said. “The gleaming marbles of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation-builders, neo-cons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities.”    Trump built his political brand with his “America First” slogan, calling for the US to focus on its own issues instead of helping — or bombing — foreign countries. But his words at the investment summit marked a stern rebuke of the neo-cons who dominated Trump’s Republican Party a decade ago. “In the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” Trump said. It is rare for US presidents to travel to the Middle East and not visit Israel, but Trump omitted the US ally from his itinerary as he toured the region. Skipping Israel was seen as a reflection of the deteriorating ties between the US administration and the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This week’s trip also came in the context of several moves perceived as evidence of the US marginalising Israel. The US has continued to hold talks with Israel’s rival Iran, announced a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen, and conducted unilateral negotiations to release Israeli soldier Edan Alexander, a US citizen, from Hamas captivity. Moreover, while touring the Gulf, Trump did not use his remarks to prioritise the establishment of formal diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which had been a top goal during his first term. It remains unclear how Trump’s decisions will affect the “special relationship” between the two allies, but experts say it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US no longer views the Middle East solely through the lens of Israel. “Is it a tactical problem for Netanyahu and the entire pro-Israel lobby? I think it is,” Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, said of Trump’s shift. “It does throw a wrench in the machinery because it is a president who is showing openly daylight with Israeli decision-making, and not just in rhetoric, but acting on it — leaving Israel out of the process.” With that chasm emerging, some Palestinian rights advocates had hoped that the US president’s trip to the region would see Washington pursue a deal to end Israel’s war on Gaza. But as Trump marvelled at the luxurious buildings in the Gulf, Israel intensified its bombardment to destroy what’s left of the Palestinian territory. No ceasefire was announced, despite reports of continuing talks in Doha. And Israel appears to be pushing forward with its plan to expand its assault on Gaza as it continues to block aid for the nearly two million people in the enclave, leading to fears of famine. United Nations experts and rights groups have described the situation as a genocide.    But despite preaching “peace and prosperity” for both Israelis and Palestinians, Trump made no strong push to end the war during this week’s trip. On Thursday, Trump suggested that he has not given up on the idea of depopulating Gaza and turning it over to the US — a proposal that legal experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing. “I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone,” he said. “Let the United States get involved, and make it just a freedom zone.” In a move that surprised many observers, Trump announced from Riyadh that he will offer sanction relief to Syria, as the country emerges from a decade-plus civil war. Trump also met with interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and described him as a “young, attractive guy”. A wholesale lifting of sanctions was not expected, in part because of Israel’s hostility to the new authorities in Syria. Israeli officials often describe al-Sharaa, who led al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria before severing ties with the group, as a “terrorist”. But Trump said he made the decision to lift the economic penalties against Syria at the request of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” the US president said. The White House said on Wednesday that Trump had a list of requests for al-Sharaa, including establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and deporting “Palestinian terrorists”. Removing US sanctions, which had been imposed on the government of former President Bashar al-Assad, is likely to be a boost for the new Syrian authorities, who are grappling with an ailing economy after years of conflict. “Lifting sanctions on Syria represents a fundamental turning point,” Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist, told Al Jazeera. “The Syrian economy will transition from interacting with developing economies to integrating with more developed ones, potentially significantly reshaping trade and investment relations.”    In Saudi Arabia, Trump declared that he wants a deal with Iran — and he wants it done quickly. “We really want them to be a successful country,” the US president said of Iran. “We want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. This is an offer that will not last forever. The time is right now for them to choose.” Trump warned Iran that, if it rejects his “olive branch”, he would impose a “massive maximum pressure” against Tehran and choke off its oil exports. Notably, Trump did not threaten explicit military action against Iran, a departure from his previous rhetoric. In late March, for instance, he told NBC News, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing.” Iran says it is not seeking nuclear weapons and would welcome a stringent monitoring programme of its nuclear facilities. But Israel and some hawks want the Iranian nuclear programme completely dismantled, not just scaled back. US and Iranian officials have held multiple rounds of talks this year, but Tehran says it has not received an official offer from Washington. And Trump officials have not explicitly indicated what the endgame of the talks is. US envoy Steve Witkoff said last month that Iran “must stop and eliminate” uranium enrichment, but days earlier, he had suggested that enrichment should be brought down to civilian energy levels. Several Gulf countries, including the three that Trump visited this week, have welcomed the nuclear negotiations, as relations between Iran and its Arab neighbours have grown more stable in recent years.    Before entering politics, Trump was a real estate mogul who played up his celebrity persona as a mega-rich dealmaker. He appears to have brought that business mindset to the White House. While in the wealthy Gulf region, Trump was in his element. He announced deals that would see Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE buy US arms and invest in American firms. According to the White House, Trump secured a total of $2 trillion in investments from the Middle East during the trip. And his administration is framing the deals as a major political and economic victory for Trump. “While it took President Biden nearly four years to secure $1 trillion in investments, President Trump achieved this in his first month, with additional investment commitments continuing to roll in,” the White House said. “President Trump is accelerating investment in America and securing fair trade deals around the world, paving the way for a new Golden Age of lasting prosperity for generations to come.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/16/five-key-takeaways-from-us-president-donald-trumps-middle-east-trip"
"economy","In surprise move Wegovy-maker Novo Nordisk ousts CEO amid sagging sales","16 May 2025",NA,"Days earlier, Novo Nordisk cut its sales and profit forecast for first time since the launch of Wegovy four years ago. Wegovy-maker Novo Nordisk has pushed out CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen over concerns the company is losing its first-mover advantage in the highly competitive obesity drug market. Novo Nordisk announced the decision on Friday. Days earlier, Novo Nordisk cut its sales and profit forecast for the first time since the launch of Wegovy four years ago, though Jorgensen had predicted a return to growth in its biggest market in the second half of this year. Novo’s chairman, Helge Lund, tried to reassure analysts and investors on a call that the company’s strategy was intact and the plan for executing it had not changed. He told the Reuters news agency that discussions to replace Jorgensen had occurred over the past few weeks. Novo said earlier that Jorgensen will remain in his role until a successor is found. Under Jorgensen’s leadership, Novo Nordisk became a world leader in the weight-loss drug market, with skyrocketing sales of its Wegovy and Ozempic treatments. Analysts and investors were unconvinced of the need to replace him. “He was leading the company for eight years and was, in my opinion, extremely successful,” Lukas Leu, a portfolio manager at Bellevue Asset Management, told Reuters. Danske Bank analyst Carsten Lonborg Madsen was similarly caught off guard. “The way we know Novo Nordisk is that normally you have patience when you’re on the right track, and then you let things move in the right direction once you have the strategy right,” he said. “It just feels like there’s something that has gone pretty wrong here,” he said on the call. Novo’s shares have plunged since hitting a record high in June last year as competition, particularly from US rival Eli Lilly, makes inroads into its market share and as its pipeline of new drugs has failed to impress investors. “The changes are made in light of the recent market challenges Novo Nordisk has been facing, and the development of the company’s share price since mid-2024,” Novo said in its statement. Jorgensen, at 58, has been CEO since 2017. He said in an interview with Danish broadcaster TV2 that he did not see the decision coming, and was only informed very recently. Booming sales of Wegovy helped make Novo the most valuable listed company in Europe, worth $615bn at its peak in June last year, but its market value has halved to about $310bn. Novo Nordisk’s share price fell on the news, trading 0.8 percent lower by 14:01 GMT after being 4 percent higher earlier in the day. The shares are down 32 percent year-to-date and 59 percent from their all-time high. Eli Lilly has seen US prescriptions for its Zepbound obesity shot surpass Wegovy since mid-March in its biggest market. Eli Lilly shares were up 2.6 percent after the news. Camilla Sylvest, Novo’s head of commercial strategy and corporate affairs and a consistent presence alongside CEO Jorgensen, stepped down last month without citing a reason.

"economy","NJ Transit workers go on strike after wage increase talks stall","16 May 2025",NA,"The strike leaves hundreds of thousands of commuters in New Jersey and New York without rail access. New Jersey’s commuter rail engineers are on strike after negotiations for higher wages failed to materialise, leaving trains idle for commuters in the third-largest transit system in the United States for the first time in more than 40 years. The strike began on Friday after The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which represents 450 NJ Transit engineers who drive the agency’s commuter trains and agency management, broke off talks late Thursday after an unsuccessful 15-hour bargaining session. The labour clash came weeks after negotiators had agreed on a potential deal in March, but the union’s members voted overwhelmingly to reject it. NJ Transit has said it cannot afford the pay rises that the engineers are seeking because 14 other unions that negotiate separate labour contracts with the agency would demand the same, higher wage rates for their members. The union pushed back on the gripe and has said that “NJT claims it doesn’t have the money to pay engineers a salary in line with industry standards, but somehow found a half-billion dollars for a new and unnecessary headquarters.” New Jersey Transit opened a new headquarters earlier this year. The union has said it is simply aiming to raise the engineers’ salaries to match those at other commuter railroads in the region. “They [rail engineers]  have gone without a raise for six years and have been seeking a new contract since October 2019,” the union said in a statement. NJ Transit says the engineers currently make $135,000 on average and that management had offered a deal that would yield an average salary of $172,000. But the union has disputed those figures, saying the current average salary is actually $113,000. The parties have exchanged accusations of bad-faith bargaining. The strike means that hundreds of thousands of daily passengers in New Jersey and New York are without service. NJ Transit said its rail system began its shutdown at 12:01am local time Friday. In a news conference, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and NJ Transit’s Chief Executive Officer Kris Kolluri told reporters talks had paused but that management remained willing to resume negotiations at any time. “We must reach a final deal that is both fair to employees and affordable,” Murphy, a Democrat, told reporters. “Let’s get back to the table and seal a deal.” Murphy and Kolluri said the US National Mediation Board had reached out to both sides to propose reopening talks on Sunday morning, or sooner if the parties wished. The union statement made no mention of when talks might be restarted. Protests began at several locations across the rail system, including NJ Transit’s headquarters in Newark, Penn Station in New York City, and the Atlantic City rail terminal. The governor and the NJ Transit CEO also outlined contingency plans for dealing with the work stoppage, the first transit strike to hit New Jersey since a three-week walkout in 1983. The looming strike had already prompted the agency to cancel trains and buses to MetLife Stadium for pop star Shakira’s concert last night and again for this evening. In an advisory, NJ Transit encouraged commuters to work from home starting on Friday if possible. The agency said it would increase bus services on existing lines and charter private buses to operate from several satellite lots in the event of a rail strike but warned buses would only be able to handle about 20 percent of rail customers. Kolluri said last week that the union was “playing a game of chicken with the lives of 350,000 riders”. “We have sought nothing more than equal pay for equal work, only to be continually rebuffed by New Jersey Transit,” Tom Haas, the union’s general chairman, said earlier this week.

"economy","Charter Communications to buy rival Cox for $21.9bn","16 May 2025",NA,"The proposed merger, which would create the largest cable provider in the US, could face antitrust hurdles. Charter Communications has agreed to buy its rival Cox Communications for $21.9bn in a deal that would unite the two of the largest cable and broadband operators in the United States as they battle streaming giants and mobile carriers for customers. The deal, announced on Friday, comes more than a decade after the companies reportedly abandoned an earlier merger attempt. Since then, pressure has intensified on cable companies, with wireless carriers attracting broadband customers with aggressive plans, while millions ditch traditional pay-TV for streaming. The companies said they expect to realise $500m in cost savings within three years of the deal’s expected close in mid-2026. Under the cash-and-stock deal, Charter will take on about $12.6bn of Cox’s net debt and other obligations, giving the transaction an enterprise value of $34.5bn. Cox Enterprises, the family-owned parent of Cox Communications, will own about 23 percent of the merged entity, with its CEO Alex Taylor serving as chairman. The combined firm will rebrand as Cox Communications within a year of the deal’s close, with Charter’s Spectrum being the consumer-facing brand. It will keep its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, while maintaining a big presence at Cox’s campus in Atlanta, Georgia. The merger with Cox – one of the biggest deals globally this year – will aid Charter’s push to bundle broadband and mobile services, helping it fend off competition from carriers. Analysts have said Charter’s strategy of combining internet, TV and mobile services into a single, customizable package has shown merit, but it needs scale as cable firms rely on leasing network access from major carriers to offer mobile plans. “This combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products,” said Charter CEO Chris Winfrey, who will head the combined company. The Spectrum-owner has a market value of nearly $60bn. On Wall Street, Charter’s stock rose on the news of the potential merger. As of 12:00pm ET (16:00 GMT) the stock is up 1.66 percent since the market opened. The merger will be among the first major tests of M&A regulation under the administration of US President Donald Trump, as it would create the largest US cable TV and broadband provider with about 38 million subscribers, surpassing current market leader Comcast. It will likely be reviewed by the US Department of Justice’s antitrust division. Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater, who leads the division, has made it clear she intends to focus on mergers that decrease competition in ways that harm consumers or workers. EMarketer analyst Ross Benes said the merged entity would be the largest US pay-TV operator, but the “ISP (internet service provider) side of the business is more consequential” for consumers, potentially positioning it as a regional monopoly. Winfrey echoed Trump’s “America First” employment priorities and said the deal would bring Cox’s customer service jobs back from overseas, but he did not specify how many. Charter’s customer service teams are already based entirely in the US. “This is the first big corporate move (in the same sector) to happen under the new Trump administration so … will set the tone for other potential moves or not,” said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore. Charter and Cox had also discussed a merger in 2013 before shelving the plan, according to media reports. But speculation had risen again in recent months after cable billionaire John Malone said in November Charter should be allowed to merge with rivals such as Cox, shortly after Charter agreed to buy his Liberty Broadband. Liberty Broadband shareholders will receive direct interest in Charter under the terms of the deal with Cox.

"economy","Has India offered Trump zero tariffs? What we know and why it matters","16 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","President Trump said India has made an offer to drop tariffs on US goods as part of ongoing trade negotiations. United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday that India had offered a trade deal that proposed almost “no tariffs” on US goods, as the South Asian nation seeks to avert higher import and export costs. India disputed Trump’s claim. But New Delhi is looking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on April 9, on so called reciprocal tariffs for major trading partners. On May 8, the White House secured a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, two days after India inked a similar pact with it. India’s equity benchmarks jumped about 1.5 percent following Trump’s comments. The Nifty 50 edged up 1.6 percent while the BSE Sensex gained 1.48 percent, reaching their highest levels in seven months. India was one of the first countries to begin trade negotiations with the US following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the White House in February, with both sides agreeing to finalise a bilateral deal this year. Last month, meanwhile, US Vice President JD Vance visited India and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, hailing what he called “very good progress” on a trade agreement between Washington and New Delhi. “It is very hard to sell in India, and they are offering us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariffs,” Trump said in a meeting with executives in the Qatari capital Doha. “They’re the highest and now they’re saying no tariff.” In a statement soon after to local news agencies, India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar pushed back against Trump’s claim, saying “nothing is decided till everything is.” He added that “any judgement on it would be premature” until a “mutually beneficial” agreement is reached. Trump didn’t provide further details of New Delhi’s apparent offer, and the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry didn’t immediately respond to media requests for comment. The US is India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling some $129bn in 2024. India ran a $45.7bn surplus with the US last year, mainly in the form of pharmaceutical products, electrical machinery and jewellery. Having long complained that India’s tariffs were too high and hurt US businesses, Trump pledged to impose “reciprocal” tariffs of 27 percent on India. Those tariffs are currently on hold until early July. A 10 percent base tariff continues to apply to India and many other nations during the pause. India’s average tariff rate is 17 percent, compared with 3.3 percent by the US, as per a report by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. In recent weeks, India has made overtures to placate Trump’s public disapproval, including lowering import duties on US goods like bourbon whiskey – down from 150 to 100 percent – and Harley-Davidson motorcycles – from 50 to 40 percent. As part of ongoing trade talks, New Delhi has also proposed zero tariffs on car parts, on a reciprocal basis and up to a certain amount, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. A delegation of Indian officials is set to visit the US later this month to try and move talks forward. The Reuters news agency reported that India’s trade minister, Piyush Goyal, might visit too. Trump’s recent comments come days after India threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs linked to higher US duties on steel and aluminium, a sign that New Delhi is adopting a more bullish approach in its negotiations with Washington. For now, though, trade talks are thought to be progressing well. Reuters reported that New Delhi has offered to reduce duties to zero on 60 percent of US imports in a first phase deal, while also offering preferential access to nearly 90 percent of the merchandise India imports from the US. In theory, this would bring the average tariff differential (the variation in tariff rates countries impose on each other) between India and the US down by 9 percentage points, significantly lowering trade barriers in the world’s fifth-largest economy. Preferential market access – or lower import entry requirements into the US compared with other countries India trades with – is being considered for key goods such as jewellery, textiles and agricultural products like bananas and grapes. “Preferential market access for India would mean better terms of trade for these goods compared to America’s other trading partners,” an Indian government official who preferred not to be named told Reuters. To make the deal more attractive for Washington, India has also offered to ease export regulations on several high-value US imports, the first official said. These include aircraft, electric vehicles, medical devices, and hydrocarbons. Beyond tariffs, India has also asked the US to treat it on par with other top US allies such as the UK and Japan in terms of access to critical technology sectors like artificial intelligence, biotech, and semiconductors. India’s expectation of being exempt from tariffs is at odds with the deal struck between the US and UK, in which only certain goods, based on mutual interest, had tariffs removed – as opposed to across-the-board withdrawals. Elsewhere, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week hinted that Washington might be looking to secure “purchase agreements” for specific products with China, as part of ongoing trade negotiations with Beijing. As such, recent trade deals suggest that Trump’s tariff strategy amounts to carve-outs on particular goods, as opposed to broad free trade agreements. Looking ahead, comments from Indian and US officials hint at a similar arrangement. Domestic issues also stand in the way of a free trade deal. India has long used tariffs to shield agricultural markets from cheap imports. Farmers have expressed fears that Modi would weaken those protections as part of a deal with Trump. Then, at the geopolitical level too, India is in a tricky position.  While Washington sees New Delhi as a counterbalance to Beijing’s growing clout, India imported $113.45bn from China last year. By contrast, it imported just $40bn from the US. What’s more, China recently warned the UK over its trade deal with the US. It accused the UK of aligning with the US in a move that could compel British companies to exclude Chinese products from their supply chains. China has warned it is ready to hurt countries that fall in line with the US in order to pressure Beijing. For its part, India has recently shown willingness to engage in trade deals after years of scepticism. Last week, it inked a pact with the UK that will substantially lower duties on many goods.

"economy","What have US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies achieved?","15 May 2025","Megha Bahree","Trump’s policies have roiled global markets and left businesses stumped on how to plan for the foreseeable future. When examining the on-again, off-again tariff proclamations of United States President Donald Trump during his second term in office, it is unclear what has actually been achieved. What is clear is that Trump’s tariff announcements have roiled global markets, wiping out trillions in value, and leaving many businesses stumped on how to plan for the future amid the never-ending uncertainty.     Within days of being sworn into office for his second term, Trump imposed 25-percent tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10 percent on China, arguing they needed to do more to stem the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migrants into the US. He soon suspended those on Canada and Mexico for 30 days – but not on China – in return for concessions on border and law enforcement. Since then, he has raised 25-percent tariffs on steel, aluminium, and auto and auto parts, and brought back levies on Mexico and Canada and doubled fentanyl-related tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20 percent. He then went back and forth on tariffs on car imports from Canada and Mexico, finally settling on a 25-percent on global car imports. Then, in April, he announced his “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries around the world, with a 10-percent baseline tariff on all countries around the world. He paused the “reciprocal” tariffs for 90 days after a bloodbath on Wall Street, but maintained the 10-percent global tax and instituted a 145-percent tax on China – which then retaliated with a 125-percent tax on US goods entering the country. Soon after, Trump started rolling back some tariffs as the US struck trade deals. The first came last week, in the form of a limited trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which kept in place the 10-percent levy on many products, but did lower US tariffs on British auto imports to 10 percent from the current 27.5 percent, annoying domestic US car-makers. But the one that everyone was watching for came earlier this week on Monday: The US and China announced a pause and scale back of tariffs for 90 days, with the US lowering its tax to 30 percent and China to 10 percent, while the two rivals hammer out a trade agreement. But even before the May 12 announcement, the US had already carved out exceptions for smartphones, computers and other tech products, that it largely imports from China. Then, per the Monday agreement, it also slashed the tariff on low-value, “de minimis” imports from China, reducing duties to 54 percent from 120 percent for items valued at up to $800. Such goods were previously brought into the US without having to pay any import duties and with minimal inspections. Such imports were heavily criticised, not only accused of flooding the country with cheap products, but for being used by traffickers to bring in drugs, including fentanyl. Fentanyl-trafficking was the justification for the initial tariffs placed on China, Mexico and Canada, so it’s not clear if the US government is still concerned about that route being potentially abused by drug hauliers. While the various tariff rollbacks and pauses have been welcomed by businesses, the respite has not removed uncertainty entirely. Brief pauses in tariffs are not sufficient for many companies to make longer-term investment or supply chain decisions.    It’s small businesses, which employ 45.9 percent of the US workforce and account for 43.5 percent of the US gross domestic product (GDP), that feel the effects most keenly because of their limited buffer, as we reported last week. There are fears that the uncertainty is taking a toll on the US economy. A Bloomberg poll of economists put the chances of a recession next year at almost 50-50, the news agency reported on Monday. And while inflation has so far been kept in check – consumer prices rose 2.3 percent in April from a year ago, down from 2.4 percent in March – economists have said they expect inflation to rise by the middle of the year, and consumer confidence has hit a 13-year low even before sky-high prices return. On Thursday Walmart, the world’s largest retailer and the biggest container importer in the US a lot of which is from China, warned it would have to start raising prices by the end of this month due to the high cost of tariffs even after they had been slashed to 30 percent. Trump has acknowledged a potential rise in prices – US children will have “two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally”, he said recently. But it’s not clear where he is headed with his tariffs, even as some companies have announced billions worth of new investments, and some that were recycling of previous ones – like Apple’s February announcement that it would invest $500bn in the US over the next four years, but which analysts said included current commitments. But that’s more a matter of the ledger for the next few years rather than jobs on the ground.

"economy","Largest US retailer Walmart warns of price hikes because of tariffs","15 May 2025",NA,"Walmart is a bellwether of US consumer health and its statement is a signpost of the impact of the trade war. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, will have to start raising prices later this month due to the high cost of tariffs, executives have warned in a clear signal that United States President Donald Trump’s trade war is filtering through to the US economy. As a bellwether of US consumer health, Walmart’s explicit statement on Thursday is also a signpost for how the trade war is affecting companies as Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low. Walmart’s shares fell 2.3 percent in morning trading after it also declined to provide a profit forecast for the second quarter, even as the company’s US comparable sales surpassed expectations in the first quarter. Net sales rose 2.5 percent to $165.6bn, a hair shy of estimates, while same-store sales were up 4.5 percent. Walmart’s quarterly adjusted profit was 61 cents per share, ahead of the analyst consensus for 58 cents per share. Many US companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of the trade war, as consumers stretch their budgets to buy everything from groceries to essentials at cheaper prices. But Walmart’s statement will resonate nationwide, as roughly 255 million people shop in its stores and online weekly around the world, and 90 percent of the US population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart. US shoppers will start to see prices rise at the end of May and certainly in June, Walmart’s Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in a CNBC interview. On a post-earnings call with analysts, he said the retailer would also have to cut back on orders as it considers price elasticity. As the largest importer of container goods in the US, Walmart is heavily exposed to tariffs, and even though the US and China reached a truce that lowered levies for imports on Chinese goods to 30 percent, that’s still a high cost to bear, executives said. “We’re very pleased and appreciative of the progress that has been made by the administration to bring tariffs down … but let me emphasise we still think that’s too high,” Rainey said on the call, referring to the tariff cuts negotiated over the weekend. “There are certain items, certain categories of merchandise that we’re dependent upon to import from other countries and the prices of those things are likely going to go up, and that’s not good for consumers,” he added.    Other retailers also said they would be boosting prices. German sandal maker Birkenstock on Thursday said it plans to raise prices globally to fully offset the impact of the US tariff of 10 percent on European Union-made goods. US consumer sentiment ebbed for a fourth straight month in April, signaling watchful purchasing, while the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted for the first time in three years during the first quarter, fanning worries of a recession. Walmart’s CEO Doug McMillon said the retailer would not be able to absorb all the tariffs’ costs because of narrow retail margins, but was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise – which primarily come from China – do not drive food prices higher. To mitigate the impact, Walmart is working with suppliers to substitute tariff-affected components, such as replacing aluminium with fibreglass, which is not subject to tariffs. Despite these efforts, McMillon noted that adjusting costs is more challenging in cases where Walmart imports food items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses from countries such as Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia. Analysts said Walmart was better positioned than rivals, as its scale enables it to lean on its suppliers and squeeze out efficiencies to shield customers from tariffs, but only so much. “There will likely be some demand destruction from tariffs; a complete wreck is unlikely,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Walmart on Thursday kept its annual sales and profit forecast intact for fiscal 2026, but withheld second-quarter operating income growth and earnings per share forecasts, citing a “fluid operating environment … [which] makes the very near term exceedingly difficult to forecast at the level and speed at which tariffs could go up”.

"economy","A US airline faces backlash as it begins deportation flights","15 May 2025",NA,"The financially struggling budget airline Avelo took a contract with the Trump administration that began this week. Avelo Airlines, a Texas-based budget carrier, is facing backlash from both customers and employees over its decision to operate deportation flights under a new contract with the Trump administration. Avelo, which has been struggling financially, signed a contract with the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last month to transport migrants to detention centres inside and outside the US, according to an internal company memo reviewed by the Reuters news agency. On Monday, the airline flew its first flight under the deal from Arizona to Louisiana, data from flight-tracking services FlightAware and Flightradar24 showed. Avelo plans to dedicate three aircraft to deportation operations and has established a charter-only base in Mesa, Arizona, specifically for these flights, according to the company memo. The union representing Avelo’s flight attendants called the contract “bad for the airline”, and one customer has helped organise a petition urging travellers to boycott the airline. US President Donald Trump has launched a hardline crackdown on undocumented immigration, including the deportation of Venezuelan migrants he accuses of being gang members to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Immigration authorities also detained and moved to deport some legal permanent US residents. Trump’s policies have triggered a rash of lawsuits and protests. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was deporting illegal aliens who broke the country’s laws. She called the protests “nothing more than a tired tactic to abolish ICE by proxy”. “Avelo Airlines is a sub-carrier on a government contract to assist with deportation flights,” McLaughlin said in a statement. “Attacks and demonization of ICE and our partners is wrong.” The airline on Wednesday confirmed its long-term agreement with ICE and said it was vital to Avelo’s financial stability. It also shared a statement from CEO Andrew Levy acknowledging that it is a “sensitive and complicated topic”, but saying that the decision on the contract came “after significant deliberations”.     The statement added that the deal would keep the airline’s “more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come”. Avelo said it will use three Boeing 737-800 planes in Mesa, Arizona. “Flights will be both domestic and international,” the company said, declining to share more details of the agreement. Avelo, which launched in 2021, was forced to suspend its most recent fundraising round after reporting its worst quarterly performance in two years. In a message to employees last month, Levy said the airline was spending more than it earned from its customers, forcing it to seek repeated infusions of capital from investors. “I realize some may view the decision to fly for DHS as controversial,” Levy wrote in the staff memo, which was reviewed by Reuters, but said the opportunity was “too valuable not to pursue”. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents Avelo’s crew, has urged the company to reconsider its decision, which it said would be “bad for the airline”. “Having an entire flight of people handcuffed and shackled would hinder any evacuation and risk injury or death,” the union said. “We cannot do our jobs in these conditions.”    The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants labelled as Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. Photos and videos have shown deportees in handcuffs and shackles. Customers have also expressed outrage. Anne Watkins, a New Haven, Connecticut, resident, said she has stopped flying with Avelo. She and her co-members at the New Haven Immigrants Coalition have launched an online petition urging travellers to boycott the airline until it ends its ICE flight operations. The petition has garnered more than 38,000 signatures. Watkins, 55, said the coalition also organised a vigil on Monday to mark the launch of Avelo’s deportation flights. “Companies can decide to operate in wholly ethical and transparent ways,” she said. “Avelo is not choosing to do that right now.” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, has threatened to review the state’s incentives for Avelo, which has received more than $2m in subsidies and tax breaks. In California, Los Angeles resident Nancy K has co-founded a campaign called “Mothers Against Avelo”. She plans to lead weekly protests every Sunday in May at Hollywood Burbank airport, one of Avelo’s six operating bases.

"economy","Claudia Sheinbaum denounces proposed US remittance tax as ‘unacceptable’","15 May 2025",NA,"Republicans have proposed the remittance tax as part of a broader push to crack down on undocumented immigration. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has denounced a provision in a tax bill being considered in the United States Congress that would impose duties on remittances — a term used to describe the money people send abroad for non-commercial reasons, often as gifts to family and loved ones. On Thursday, during her morning news conference, Sheinbaum addressed the tax bill directly, calling the remittances proposal “a measure that is unacceptable”. “It would result in double taxation, since Mexicans living in the United States already pay taxes,” she said. She added that her government was reaching out to other countries with large immigrant populations to voice concern about the US proposition. “This will not just affect Mexico,” she said. “It will also affect many other countries and many other Latin American countries.” According to World Bank data from 2024, India is the top recipient of international remittances, with $129bn coming from abroad, followed by Mexico with more than $68bn. In Mexico, in particular, experts estimate that remittances make up close to 4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). But a far-reaching tax bill championed by US President Donald Trump includes language that would impose a 5-percent excise tax on remittances sent specifically by non-citizens, including visa holders and permanent residents. That bill would affect nearly 40 million people living in the country. US citizens, however, would be exempt from the remittance tax. Trump has led a campaign to discourage immigration to the US and promote “mass deportation” during his second term in office, as part of his “America First” agenda. Proponents of that platform say taxing remittances would serve as clear deterrence to immigrants who come to the US looking for better economic opportunities for themselves and any loved ones they hope to support back home. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank, told The Associated Press news agency that he believes barriers to remittances can help curb undocumented immigration to the US. “One of the main reasons people come here is to work and send money home,” Krikorian said. “If that’s much more difficult to do, it becomes less appealing to come here.” Under the bill being weighed in the House of Representatives, the 5-percent tax would be paid by the sender and collected by “remittance transfer providers”, who would then send that money to the US Treasury. But President Sheinbaum and other leaders have called on Republicans in Congress to reconsider that provision, given the unintended consequences it could create. Sheinbaum even suggested that the tax could be seen as unconstitutional in the US. “This is an injustice, apart from being unconstitutional,” she said on Thursday. “But in addition, it is the tax on those who have the least. They should charge taxes to those at the top, not those at the bottom.” Critics of the measure point out that remittances can help stabilise impoverished areas abroad, thereby limiting the likelihood of undocumented migration from those areas. Additional barriers to sending remittances could create economic setbacks for those communities, not to mention make the process more difficult for US citizens who are exempted from the proposed tax. Still, even if the tax bill is defeated or the provision on remittances removed, the Trump administration has signalled it plans to move forward with other measures designed to discourage migrants from sending funds abroad. On April 25, Trump posted on his media platform, Truth Social, a list of “weekly policy achievements”. On the final page, the top bullet point under “international relations” was “finalizing a Presidential Memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside the United States”. Trump called the document a “MUST READ”.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/15/claudia-sheinbaum-denounces-proposed-us-remittance-tax-as-unacceptable"

Gary Lineker, a former England captain and the face of football on British television for more than two decades, will leave the BBC, the public broadcaster said in a statement on Monday. Lineker, 64, had been due to cover the 2026 FIFA World Cup for the BBC, but his early departure comes after he apologised last week for sharing a social media post about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat, historically used as an anti-Semitic insult. Lineker said that he deleted the posts after learning of the offensive references. According to multiple British media reports, the high-profile host is “bowing out by mutual agreement”. He rose to become the BBC’s highest-paid star after presenting its Match of the Day (MOTD) highlights show for 25 years. The BBC announced last November that he would step down from MOTD this year, but carry on working for it until 2026. “Gary has acknowledged the mistake he made. Accordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season,” BBC director general Tim Davie said in a statement. Lineker repeated his apology on Monday, saying he would never consciously repost anything anti-Semitic. “I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am,” he said. “Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.” In recent years, Lineker’s desire to put forward his political views on social media has caused headaches for the BBC, which has strict rules on impartiality. He was temporarily taken off air in 2023 after he criticised the previous government’s immigration policy on social media. In 2018, he opposed Brexit and called for a second referendum. But it was Lineker’s support for the Palestinians affected by the war on Gaza that most recently brought him into conflict with the BBC. Lineker had already caused friction at the public broadcaster when he recently said Israel was to blame for the origins of the Gaza conflict, because it turned the occupied territory into an “outdoor prison”. Speaking on May 9 in an interview with The Telegraph at the Football Business Awards, just days before he was accused of the anti-Semitic social post on X, Lineker expressed that his issues are with the Israeli government rather than Jewish people. “Obviously, October 7 was awful, but it’s very important to know your history and to study the massacres that happened prior to this, many of them against the Palestinian people,” he said in the interview with The Telegraph, which was published last Thursday, on May 15. “Yes, Israelis have a right to defend themselves. But it appears that Palestinians don’t – and that is where it’s wrong. Palestinians are caged in this outdoor prison in Gaza, and now it’s an outdoor prison that they’re bombing,” Lineker added. In the same interview, the TV host also disputed whether Israel could justifiably argue that it was still acting in self-defence. “I understand that they needed to avenge, but I don’t think they’ve helped their own hostage situation at all,” Lineker said. “People say it’s a complex issue, but I don’t think it is. It’s inevitable that the Israeli occupation was going to cause massive problems, and I just feel for the Palestinians.” The former striker played for England for eight years until 1992 and had been a top scorer for Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur in the 1980s and early 1990s. He is also the co-founder of a podcasting production business, Goalhanger, which makes series such as the podcasts The Rest Is History and The Rest Is Football. Lineker will leave his role at the BBC on Sunday after his final episode of Match of the Day.

"sports","US PGA Championship 2025: Scottie Scheffler wins third major title","19 May 2025",NA,"World number one Scottie Scheffler outlasts a final round challenge from Jon Rahm to record a five-stroke victory in golf’s second major of the year. Scottie Scheffler held off a spirited effort by Spain’s Jon Rahm to secure a five-shot PGA Championship victory at Quail Hollow Club for his third career major title. The top-ranked Scheffler, who was three shots clear of Swede Alex Noren at the start of the day, struggled off the tee early on Sunday but righted the ship in time for the back nine to card an even-par 71 that left him at 11 under for the week. “I knew it was going to be a challenging day, finishing off a major championship is always challenging,” Scheffler said on the 18th green after being presented with the Wanamaker Trophy. “I didn’t have my best stuff … but stepped it up on the back nine.” Ryder Cup hopeful Harris English, who began his day 11 shots adrift, shot a 65 that was the low round of the day and finished in a distant share of second place alongside fellow Americans Bryson DeChambeau (70) and Davis Riley (72). Twice major champion Rahm (73) gave Scheffler a scare early on the back nine but came apart in stunning fashion with five dropped shots over his final three holes to slide back into a share of eighth place. Rahm, who began the day five shots back of the lead and playing two groups ahead of Scheffler, took a while to get going in the final round but found his groove right in time to set up some back-nine drama at Quail Hollow Club. The Spaniard joined Scheffler atop the leaderboard when, at the par-four 11th, he made his third birdie over a four-hole stretch, but Scheffler reclaimed the outright lead with a 9-foot birdie at the 10th moments later. Rahm nearly answered right back, but his perfectly paced 19-foot birdie attempt at the par-three 13th curled around and out of the cup before going on to misread birdie putts at the next two holes, followed by his brutal closing stretch. Scheffler added birdies at 14 and 15 and then saw his lead suddenly grow to five over JT Poston after Rahm made double-bogey at the par-three 17th, where he blasted his tee shot into the water. “It’s a tough pill to swallow right now,” said Rahm. “Pretty fresh wound right now. But there’s been a lot of good happening this week and a lot of positive feelings to take for the rest of the year.” US Open champion DeChambeau, who finished runner-up at last year’s PGA Championship, was driving the ball and giving himself chances, but struggled on the greens. “I felt like I had the game to win this week, and the golf course suited me pretty well, missed a few putts coming down the stretch and got a little unlucky in this great game of golf,” said DeChambeau. “It was a good fight, good battle, take a lot from it. It’s just burning a bigger fire in my belly.” Noren, playing alongside Scheffler and alone in second place to start the day, stayed in the mix until his round unravelled with a trio of bogeys early on the back nine. Scheffler took home a $3.42m top prize from a record $19m purse.

"sports","Thunder vs Nuggets: OKC win Game 7, reach Western Conference finals","19 May 2025",NA,"Oklahoma City Thunder dominate Game 7 playoff decider against Denver Nuggets to set up a Western Conference finals clash against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 35 points to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 125-93 home win over the Denver Nuggets in Game 7 of their Western Conference second-round NBA playoff series. The Thunder advanced to the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2016. They open the conference finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves at home on Tuesday. After scoring just six points in Thursday’s loss, Thunder All-Star Jalen Williams bounced back in a big way, pouring in 24 points on 10-of-17 shooting in Sunday’s Game 7. Gilgeous-Alexander was 12 of 19 from the floor with three steals and no turnovers. “He [Williams] was amazing,” said Gilgeous-Alexander. “He wouldn’t have played the way he played today last year, I know that 100 percent. To see him take that step forward is a really proud moment.” Early on, it looked like the Nuggets were carrying over the momentum from their Game 6 win. They led by double digits with a minute left in the first quarter before the Thunder ripped off a 13-0 run spanning the first and second quarters to take the lead for the first time. The Thunder grabbed the lead for good on Luguentz Dort’s 3-pointer with 7 minutes 20 seconds left in the first half. They closed the first half on an 18-5 run, including back-to-back Nuggets turnovers that led to Williams’s buckets at the other end and helped the Thunder build a 60-46 lead at half time. Then the Thunder put the game on ice with a 37-point third quarter, with 10 of those coming off the Nuggets’ five turnovers. The Thunder led by as many as 43 points in the fourth quarter. The Nuggets were also 3 of 14 from beyond the arc in the third quarter and finished the game just 10 of 45 on 3-pointers. “To have the start we wanted and then to have it go sideways so quickly [was tough],” said Nuggets’ interim coach David Adelman. “I thought we controlled the pace of the game early, it’s easy to forget that now … Once they got back into it, they kept bringing new people in and it did overwhelm us.” A big part of the Thunder’s success was thanks to Alex Caruso’s defence. Despite a considerable deficit, Caruso spent plenty of time on Nuggets star Nikola Jokic, who often found it difficult to find shots against Oklahoma City’s top-ranked defence. Jokic scored 20 points on 5-of-9 shooting, while Caruso finished with a game-best plus-40 plus/minus rating. “The volume of it today was a result of how effective it was, but looking at it was a priority going into today,” said Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault regarding Caruso’s efforts. “He did an unbelievable job individually.” The Thunder scored 37 points off Denver’s 23 turnovers, while giving the ball up just 10 times themselves. Nuggets forward Aaron Gordon, who suffered a hamstring injury late in Game 6 and was a game-time decision, played more than 24 minutes, finishing with eight points and 11 rebounds. “It means a lot, specifically for the city,” said Gilgeous-Alexander on advancing to the conference finals. “They’ve been so good all year. They’ve been behind us, through good, through bad. No team in the league has a home-court advantage like we do.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/19/thunder-vs-nuggets-okc-win-game-7-reach-western-conference-finals"
"sports","Lionel Messi, Inter Miami lose to Orlando City in MLS","19 May 2025",NA,"Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami had one of their worst performances of the season, losing at home to their Florida rivals. Lionel Messi’s frustration grew as Inter Miami’s miserable run continued with a 3-0 loss at home to Orlando City in Major League Soccer (MLS). The Florida derby defeat on Sunday leaves Miami with one win from their last seven games in all competitions. They have slipped to sixth in the Eastern Conference, with Orlando leapfrogging them. Messi had just two shots on target and scuffed a free-kick as his form slumped with that of his team. “Now, we’ll truly see if we’re a team in difficult times, because when everything’s going well, it’s very easy,” Messi told Apple TV. “When difficult times come, that’s when we have to be more united than ever, be a true team, and pull ourselves together,” he added. Messi questioned the refereeing, but in truth, the loss had little to do with officiating and much to do with shambolic defending, a disjointed midfield and a punchless attack led by the rapidly fading Luis Suarez. Orlando grabbed the lead in the 43rd minute with a goal of absurd simplicity. Goalkeeper Pedro Gallese launched the ball downfield, and Luis Muriel ran clear and slotted past Oscar Ustari. The visitors were getting plenty of joy from going direct against a Miami backline, which was all at sea. Argentinian Martin Ojeda should have done better when he found himself clear on goal, but blasted over. Miami’s veteran keeper Ustari made a fine double save, but then the 38-year-old found himself to blame for Orlando’s second goal. The ball fell to Marco Pasalic on the edge of the box, and his low shot went through the hands and legs of Ustari to double the Orlando lead. Miami coach Javier Mascherano threw on attacking players in a bid to retrieve something from the game, but it was in vain. In the fourth minute of stoppage time, Duncan McGuire broke down the left, and his low cross was slotted home by Icelandic forward Dagur Thorhallsson to wrap up an impressive performance from the visitors. Miami have conceded 20 goals in their last seven games, with their only victory coming against the New York Red Bulls on May 3. Mascherano said the first goal changed the game. “I’d say for 25 or 30 minutes, we had it completely under control playing in the opponent’s half, but this is how it is, clearly. I’m not going to deny what the result is,” he said. Miami’s MLS campaign was going well until their exit in the Concacaf Champions Cup at the hands of the Vancouver Whitecaps. Mascherano admitted the team’s morale had been hit. “Clearly, something has happened where the team has lost a lot of confidence. We have had a drop in level, individually and collectively, and it’s clear one way or another – we have tried with different schemes, different names, and still today, we are hurting. We will keep trying to find a way.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/19/lionel-messi-inter-miami-lose-to-orlando-city-in-mls"
"sports","Verstappen wins F1 Emilia-Romagna GP to close gap on McLaren duo","18 May 2025",NA,"Reigning world champion Max Verstappen wins for the fourth straight time at Imola, defeating McLaren’s Lando Norris and F1 drivers’ standings leader Oscar Piastri. Max Verstappen has given his Formula 1 title defence a big boost with victory at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix after a daring overtake on standings leader Oscar Piastri at the start. The Dutch driver built a commanding lead on Sunday that was wiped out when the safety car bundled the field back up. He still held on to win ahead of Lando Norris, who overtook his McLaren teammate Piastri for second with five laps remaining. Verstappen took his second win of the season and first since last month’s Japanese Grand Prix and denied Piastri – who finished third – what would have been his fourth victory in a row. Verstappen praised his Red Bull team’s “fantastic execution all round” as the team marked its 400th F1 race with a win. “The start itself wasn’t particularly great, but I was still on the outside line, or basically the normal [racing] line, and I was like, ‘Well, I’m just going to try and send it round the outside,’ and it worked really well,” Verstappen said of his crucial overtake. “That, of course, unleashed our pace because once we were in the lead, the car was good.” Norris’s late-race move on Piastri was almost a copy of Verstappen’s although Norris had the advantage of being on fresher tyres than his teammate. “We had a good little battle at the end between Oscar and myself, which is always tense but always good fun,” Norris said, admitting that Verstappen and Red Bull were “too good for us today”. Piastri’s lead over Norris in the standings was cut to 13 points. Verstappen rounds out the top three at nine points behind Norris. Lewis Hamilton recovered from 12th on the grid to finish fourth in his first race for Ferrari in Italy. Hamilton profited from a late-race fight between his teammate Charles Leclerc and Alex Albon of Williams. Albon complained Leclerc had pushed him off the track as they battled for fourth, and Hamilton passed both drivers before Ferrari eventually asked Leclerc to yield fifth to Albon. George Russell was seventh for Mercedes, ahead of Carlos Sainz Jr in the second Williams. Isack Hadjar was ninth for Racing Bulls, and Verstappen’s Red Bull teammate Yuki Tsunoda was 10th after starting last following a crash in qualifying. Overtaking was expected to be rare in what could be F1’s last race for the foreseeable future at Imola. Instead, the Italian fans were treated to Verstappen’s spectacular move at the start and plenty of other overtakes. The narrow, bumpy Imola track has been a favourite among drivers, who have relished its old-school challenge since it returned to the F1 schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, its status as Italy’s second race – only the United States also hosts more than one – makes its position vulnerable. “If we don’t come back here, it is going to be a shame,” Piastri said on Saturday. Sunday’s race was the last under Imola’s current contract, and while it isn’t officially goodbye yet, there has been no word about next year.

"sports","FA Cup Final 2025: Crystal Palace defeat Man City in major upset","17 May 2025",NA,"Crystal Palace win their first major trophy by beating Manchester City 1-0 in the FA Cup final at Wembley stadium. Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze sparked a massive south London party by scoring the only goal to win the FA Cup 1-0 against Manchester City and claim the club’s first major trophy in their history. Local man Eze volleyed in after 16 minutes, former Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson performed heroics in the Palace goal, and City contrived to waste a sack-load of chances, including a penalty, in an enthralling final on Saturday. After England forward Eze, whose goals in the last eight and semis fired his team into the final for the third time, scored completely against the run of play, Palace had to survive a City siege to spark wild celebrations. Omar Marmoush had a first-half penalty saved by Henderson as City lost in the Cup final for a second successive season, summing up a harrowing campaign in which they have been dethroned as the powerhouse of English football and will go without a domestic trophy for the first time since 2016-17. For Palace’s massed ranks decked in purple and blue, it was a day of unbridled joy as Oliver Glasner’s team rode their luck to make it third time lucky after suffering defeats in their previous two FA Cup final appearances in 1990 and 2016. Glasner, who took charge of the club 15 months ago, becomes the first Austrian coach to win the FA Cup. City have been a pale imitation of the side that has dominated the English game for most of the past decade. But the way they began at Wembley suggested that Pep Guardiola’s side were determined to prove that talk of their demise had been greatly exaggerated. Having picked an ultra-attacking lineup shorn of defensive midfielders, City hemmed Palace deep inside their own half for the opening 15 minutes with Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings on what was his last Wembley appearance in City’s colours. His lofted ball picked out Erling Haaland, whose stretching effort at the far post was brilliantly saved by Henderson, who also shortly afterwards beat out Josko Gvardiol’s header. Palace finally broke the siege, and in their first foray beyond the centre circle, they ripped through City’s lines. Jean-Philippe Mateta played in Daniel Munoz, and his cross was met by Eze, who flashed a first-time volley past Stefan Ortega to provoke an eruption of noise from the Palace fans. Ismaila Sarr nearly made it 2-0, but Ortega saved, and Palace’s hearts were in their mouths when Henderson appeared to have handled the ball outside his area under pressure from Haaland, but a subsequent VAR check spared him a possible red card. There was no escape for Palace defender Tyrick Mitchell when he tripped Bernardo Silva, and referee Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot. Surprisingly, Haaland did not take it and instead Omar Marmoush stepped forward for his first penalty since joining City in January, but his effort lacked conviction and Henderson dived to his right to save. Henderson made a flying save to keep out Jeremy Doku’s curling effort as Palace reached half-time ahead despite having only 19 percent of possession. Munoz thought he had made it 2-0 just past the hour mark, but a lengthy VAR check ruled his effort out for offside. Seven-time winners City went close numerous times after the break, with Henderson and his defenders performing heroics to preserve Palace’s lead. A huge groan went up from the Palace fans as 10 minutes of stoppage time, but after more close shaves and nail-biting, the final whistle sounded and the club’s anthem Glad All Over bellowed around the stadium.

"sports","Everton’s Goodison Park stages final Premier League match","17 May 2025","Adam Hancock","Everton play their final Premier League match at Goodison Park on Sunday at a venue steeped in history and tradition. Liverpool, England – “I love it when it gets like this,” exclaimed the man beside me as he rubbed his hands with glee. It was the Halloween of 2009 and in the gloom of an early winter’s afternoon, Goodison Park was at its best. Everton were playing Aston Villa in a league match, which was becoming increasingly bad-tempered. Two late red cards, an appalling referee and the floodlights taking full effect. It was the perfect recipe for a big bowl of Goodison fury. The game finished as an unmemorable 1-1 draw, but the sheer delight of the man in the neighbouring seat long stayed with me. His excitement was a reminder to relish those rare occasions when the entire audience at this glorious theatre of football are united in emotion. And nowhere does emotion quite like Goodison Park. Fury, relief, joy and despair – and that’s just a two-nil defeat to Norwich in the League Cup fourth round. Fans sitting in this footballing relic have felt it all throughout the stadium’s long and illustrious history. If they gave out Ballon d’Ors for booing, Everton would need a separate stadium just to house the trophy cabinet. But on Sunday, there will be new emotions to add to the list – because everything is about to change. A 133-year chapter in the story of Everton is about to end, as Goodison Park hosts the men’s team for the final time. “Goodison has just always been there, there’s not an Evertonian alive that has watched Everton anywhere else,” said Matt Jones, host of the Blue Room podcast. Like thousands of fellow fans, he will spend the weekend grappling with various emotions. “I feel a bit like a dad watching his daughter get married at a wedding and everything’s starting to make him cry. As you get closer and closer to the day, you get more and more emotional,” Jones told Al Jazeera Sport. At its most basic level, Sunday’s fixture against Southampton is game number 2,791 for the Everton men’s senior team at Goodison. But for Evertonians, it represents so much more. A part of our identity is about to be lost. I’ve grown from a boy to a man in various seats in every stand of that grand old stadium, learning every swear word there is to know along the way. The highs and lows of the last 30 years have been intertwined with trips there, with the ground somehow able to block out everyday life for 90 precious minutes. Much like the inability to get a phone signal inside, you leave your troubles at the turnstile. I’ve taken various partners to Goodison (one said that she had “never seen rage quite like it”), with most of those relationships ending in the same sort of heartbreak as an Everton cup run. But I’ve always felt privileged to sit inside a real-life museum of football. Surrounded by history, tradition and furious middle-aged men abusing anything that moves. The next page of the Everton story will see the men’s team relocate to a 53,000-capacity stadium at Bramley Moore Dock. The impressive structure sits on the banks of the river Mersey and, for the sake of sponsorship, will be called the Hill Dickinson Stadium. Life in such a shiny, modern arena will be a huge adjustment for one of the oldest teams in English football. “It’s that feeling of leaving your family home. It’s the only way I can describe it,” said Merseyside-based sports reporter Giulia Bould. “You know you’re going to a house with a load of mod cons and you know your life’s going to be so much easier in this new house, but you’ve got to leave your family home. It’s weird,” she added. This season has been filled with finals for Everton, although sadly not the ones that are played at Wembley with a trophy on the line. Instead, each fixture at Goodison has ticked another final occasion off the list. From the final cup game to the final night match, even the final Saturday 3pm kickoff has had a shoutout. But on Sunday, it really will be the finale – although only for the men’s team. Just days before what was due to be the final ever Goodison game, Everton announced that the old stadium would be granted a stay of execution. The bulldozers won’t move in – instead the women’s team will. “I think it’s perfect,” said Bould as she reflects on the decision from Everton’s American owners to pass Goodison over to the women’s team. “Under the previous owner, the women’s side has long been ignored and run into the ground really, it’s been pretty much treated as second rate. But now it has been put on a level where it should be, setting the precedent for everyone else,” Bould told Al Jazeera Sport. Goodison Park is no stranger to setting a precedent. It was the first purpose-built football stadium in England and the first to install dugouts and undersoil heating. The Toffees’ long run without relegation means it’s hosted more English top-flight football games than anywhere else. Goodison was also the venue for an FA Cup Final and a World Cup semifinal, with Pele and Eusebio both also scoring there during the 1966 tournament. Even North Korea has graced the Goodison turf. The storied history of Everton’s home has caught the imagination of some of the greats of the modern game. Jose Mourinho called the place “the history of English football”, while Arsene Wenger described it as “one of the noisiest” stadiums he’s managed in. Sir Alex Ferguson once spared former Evertonian Wayne Rooney from an afternoon at Goodison with Manchester United, purely because of the abuse he would receive. Visiting Goodison Park today feels vastly removed from the riches of modern English football. To put it bluntly, the stadium is no longer fit for purpose. But that is what makes it magical. “It is the closest you can get to travelling through time to watch football,” said photographer and Evertonian Gary Lambert. That time travel begins before you even set foot in the stadium. “Physically, Goodison is an imposing place. It appears out of nowhere between the rows of terraced houses,” said Lambert. Once inside, the stadium’s history unravels through the various sights and sounds. Obstructed views are common, with posts and pillars causing many a strained neck. And the unique Archibald Leitch criss-cross design runs down the middle of the ancient Bullens Road stand. “Goodison Park is the bluest place on earth. The brickwork on three-quarters of the ground is painted a vivid shade of royal blue. “It doesn’t matter what tweaked blue hue the latest kit manufacturer might tone the latest home shirt, it’s that blue outside which is Everton’s blue,” Lambert told Al Jazeera Sport. But there is one particular quirk that stands out above them all and it happens whenever Everton go on the attack. “There are still so many old-fashioned wooden seats, so the seats bang and click as everyone moves to stand up,” said Bould. The chorus of wooden clangs is something she will miss when Everton move away from their historical home. “That clicking noise, you don’t hear that anywhere. That, for me, is Goodison.” Like all Everton fans, I’ll miss the matchday routines around Goodison. Parking near the snooker hall, a pre-match pint in Crofts Social Club, the endless queues for the loo. I might even miss the lack of legroom. It’s troubling to comprehend life after Goodison for Everton’s men. The two are so connected and so well-suited. Everton is Goodison and Goodison is Everton. A divorce after 133 years was always going to hurt. But change is needed for a club still clinging to former glories. Everton’s new ground could be the chance for a new start. The Hill Dickinson Stadium doesn’t suit us, but it represents the new world of football, where money is power. In many ways, Sunday’s fixture will be a changing of the guard as the grand old team is hurtled into the modern age. “We’re at the end of such a long journey now at Goodison. And at just the very start and the very first step of a new one. “And maybe we’re quite privileged to be at this crossover point and experience both of them,” said Jones.

Doha, Qatar – Loud cheers greeted Letsile Tebogo when he stepped onto the track for the men’s 200-metre race at the World Athletics Doha Diamond League in Qatar and stepped away a winner a few minutes later. The Botswanan Olympic gold medallist made his Doha debut with a time of 20.10 seconds on a balmy Friday evening, coolly glancing sideways at his closest competitor as he crossed the finish line 0.01s ahead of Courtney Lindsey of the United States (US). It was a leisurely run compared with his triumphant 19.46s finish at the Stade de France nine months ago, when he left a star-studded American lineup – including 100m gold medal winner Noah Lyles – in his wake as he brought Botswana its first Olympic gold. As a young boy, Tebogo was a keen footballer with a preference for manning the left wing, but was pushed towards athletics by his teachers. Seven years later, the reluctant sprinter made the world sit up and take notice as he became the first African to win a 200m gold at the Olympics. A day prior to the Doha Diamond League, the World Athletics 2024 Athlete of the Year sat down with Al Jazeera to reflect on his achievement in Paris and its the impact on the African continent: Al Jazeera: How has life changed for you since winning the Olympic gold?Letsile Tebogo: In so many ways. To begin with, there’s increased awareness of the scale of my achievement, which has brought along commercial interest. I now have multiple opportunities to support myself as multiple brands want to be associated with my name. What I’m most excited about, though, is the impact I have made on aspiring athletes. I have proved that by staying on the right track and working hard, it is possible to achieve your dreams no matter which part of the world you’re from. Wherever you are, whatever you have, just make sure you put in enough effort and dedication. Al Jazeera: How difficult is it for you to step out of your house when you’re in Botswana?Tebogo: I’m never out unless it’s for an event. I stay locked up indoors because I don’t want to be out there too much.
I like having an element of mystery and want to leave people wondering: where is he, what’s he doing? Al Jazeera: How does it feel to break the American and Jamaican hold on sprinting medals at the Olympics?Tebogo: That’s always been my goal. To snap their dominance. It was sad to see only two nations rule the sport for decades. I wanted to make a breakthrough for African athletes. I aspired to be the one to make it happen and then take in the world’s response. And that reaction has been heartwarming. Al Jazeera: When compared with the success in distance running, Africa has not been able to bag as many medals in sprinting. What challenges do African athletes face when it comes to sprinting at the highest level? Tebogo: It’s mostly down to infrastructure and support but I am not entirely sure. However, I can see that Africa is looking towards investing in its athletes beyond distance running. Once the governments are on board, it makes a massive difference to the sport. Al Jazeera: Can you see the impact of your success for Batswana athletes? Tebogo: It’s still early days but I’ve definitely seen athletes shed a layer of self-doubt. They are no longer afraid of coming forward to showcase their talent. I hope the new [Botswana] government will take the next step and help these athletes. Al Jazeera: How do you see the future of sprinting in Africa?Tebogo: Africans are stepping up and we see an increased number of African athletes in global competitions. I dream of an all-African lineup at the Olympics one day.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/17/q-african-sprinters"

Mikal Bridges had 22 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 21 points and 12 rebounds for third-seeded New York, which led by as many as 41 points on Friday. The Knicks wrapped up the best-of-seven series with the largest winning playoff margin in franchise history. “There’s more to go,” Bridges said. “We’re not done. We came out there tonight and played hard and handled business. But our season is not over. We have much more to go.” New York surpassed a 36-point playoff victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in the decisive Game 5 of the 1970 Eastern Division finals. Josh Hart contributed 10 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists to record New York’s first postseason triple-double since Walt Frazier accomplished the feat in 1972. “I want to congratulate the Celtics on a terrific season,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “Unfortunate injury to Jayson Tatum. They’re a terrific organisation, ownership, front office, Joe Mazzulla is a terrific coach, great players. “They’re not going to hand you anything. You have to earn it.” The Knicks will open the conference finals at home against the fourth-seeded Indiana Pacers on Wednesday. Defending NBA champion Boston was led by Jaylen Brown, who had 20 points, six rebounds and six assists before fouling out late in the third quarter. The Celtics were again short-handed after losing Tatum to a ruptured right Achilles during Game 4 on Monday. “Upset or not, we beat a great team,” Brunson said. “They obviously lost a huge piece (in Tatum). The way they came out in Game 5, they’re still a good team. Regardless of what anyone thinks – upset or not – we’re just happy to come out of the series with a win and now we’ll prepare for another team.” New York shot 46.2 percent from the field, including 16 of 45 (35.6 percent) from 3-point range. The Knicks held a 55-36 rebounding advantage. Payton Pritchard scored 11 points and Al Horford added 10 for Boston, which shot 36 percent and was 12 of 40 (30 percent) from 3-point range. The score was tied at 16 before the Knicks began pulling away. New York led 26-20 at the end of the first quarter and then opened the second with a 16-4 surge to open up an 18-point lead midway through the period. After Boston’s Luke Kornet interrupted the burst with a three-point play, the Knicks rattled off 16 of the next 21 points to take a 58-32 lead on a putback dunk by Miles “Deuce” McBride with 1:31 left. McBride buried a 3-pointer as time expired in the half for a 64-37 lead at the break. That marked New York’s largest halftime advantage at the break since leading the Los Angeles Lakers 69-42 in Game 7 of the 1970 Finals, won by the Knicks. “You win a championship and you have that target on your back from Day 1,” Celtics guard Derrick White said of falling well short of winning back-to-back NBA titles. “There’s ups and downs through every season. This part sucks and we didn’t complete the goal that we set out to get.” The contest was effectively over when Brown fouled out with 2:50 left in the third quarter and Boston down by 33. Anunoby poured it on with consecutive 3-pointers to end a 10-0 push as the margin went above 40 at 92-51 with 1:51 remaining in the third. “They played better than we did,” Mazzulla said. “I’m happy for Thibs [Thibodeau]. He’s been coaching for a long time. That’s the biggest thing. You pay your dues, you put forth everything. That guy is a lifer. He’s what a coach is all about and he deserves it. And they deserve it as a team. You got to take your hat off to them.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/17/knicks-oust-celtics-in-game-6-playoffs-make-eastern-conference-finals"
"sports","FA Cup Final 2025: Guardiola sees win as ‘massively important’ to Man City","16 May 2025","Kevin Hand","Pep Guardiola admits FA Cup is not the first choice but final is ‘massively important’ to Man City. The FA Cup was not Manchester City’s top priority this season, but now that they are in a third straight final, the club will go all out to win the trophy at Wembley, manager Pep Guardiola said. City have had a “horrific season” in the words of striker Erling Haaland, with Guardiola’s side falling by the wayside in the Premier League title race while they were also eliminated in the Champions League knockout phase playoffs. City are fourth in the Premier League and yet to secure Champions League qualification for next season – winning the FA Cup when they face Crystal Palace on Saturday may not be enough to salvage their campaign. “That is the problem, right? The FA Cup now is not the first choice. Of course, we want it. Once we are here, of course, we want the trophy. It is massively important,” Guardiola told reporters on Friday. “It was a disappointment last season [losing in the final to Manchester United]. But I’m pretty sure we’ll perform well, and we are going to compete against them. “It’s the final of the FA Cup, it’s an honour and a privilege. Third time in a row being there, and we have to perform well. We travel to London to win the title.” Guardiola also praised Oliver Glasner’s Palace, who knocked out fellow Premier League sides Fulham and Aston Villa to reach the final. Palace, who are 12th in the league table, are seeking their first major trophy, having fallen in the final in 1990 and 2016, losing to Manchester United on both occasions. “It is a fantastic team. They have had a really good second part of the season. They have had more than a year with Oliver working with the same players,” Guardiola said. “They are a threat because they have quality. [Striker Jean-Philippe] Mateta is strong and the quality in [Eberechi] Eze is obvious and, of course, the pace from [fellow forward Ismaila] Sarr … [Adam] Wharton is a really good holding midfielder. “They are well structured defensively and their set-pieces are one of the best in the Premier League.” The quiet confidence seeping out of Crystal Palace’s training ground before the final against Manchester City was summed up by manager Oliver Glasner on Friday. “We’re focused on what we want to do at Wembley. We analysed Man City, but 90 percent, we were talking about us,” Glasner, who will become the first Austrian to lead a team in an FA Cup final, told reporters. “This is what we can influence. We can influence our performance. We can influence what we want to do in and out of possession. And the focus was on our game. We have a lot of confidence and looking forward to the final.” Palace may be 12th in the Premier League, but have matched their record points tally with two games still to play. In the FA Cup, they have clicked impressively, winning 3-0 at Fulham in the quarterfinals and then beating Villa by the same margin at Wembley in the semis. Now, they have one last obstacle to get over and claim the south London club’s first major trophy in its 120-year history. Palace drew 2-2 with City at Selhurst Park in the league and led 2-0 in the return fixture, only to lose 5-2. They also lost 4-2 last April, a couple of months after Glasner took charge. Scoring goals against Pep Guardiola’s team has not been a problem, but Glasner knows they will need to adjust defensively to give themselves the best possible chance at Wembley. “In every single game [against City] we scored two goals, but we just had one draw, because we conceded four, two and five, so we have to make a few adjustments in our defending,” he said. “Because when you concede five, it’s tough to win, but when you score two, you should be able to win. “So, we have confidence that we will create our chances, we will create our situations to score goals, but we have to do better in defence, and I don’t mean the back three or the back five. So as a team, maybe we have to adjust a few things, and this is what we want to do tomorrow.” Palace fans, hoping it will be third time lucky in Cup finals after defeats in 1990 and 2016, produced a wall of sound and colour in the semifinal against Villa and are bound to give their side passionate support again on Saturday. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson was one of several Palace players to donate to a fundraising campaign for a giant “tifo” against Villa, and another 45,000 pounds has been raised for one to be unfurled before Saturday’s Wembley showdown. “The one against Villa was top class,” said Henderson. “I don’t know what they are going to do with 40-odd grand – but I’m excited to see it.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/16/fa-cup-final-2025-guardiola-sees-win-as-massively-important-to-man-city"

Who: Manchester City vs Crystal PalaceWhat: English FA Cup finalWhere: Wembley Stadium, London, United KingdomWhen: Saturday at 4:30pm (15:30 GMT) Follow Al Jazeera Sport‘s live text and photo commentary stream. Manchester City and Crystal Palace go head-to-head for the FA Cup in a final that has captured the imagination the world over since its inception. English football’s showpiece cup final has been a tale of a team from any level – even non-professional – rising to the top to take down the giants of the game. The Eagles of South London are no minnows in this story, but their opponents are as big as they come in the global game. Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at a showdown that carries great weight for both teams in the world’s oldest cup competition. History beckons for Crystal Palace against a Manchester City side that have one final shot at avoiding a rare trophyless season under Pep Guardiola. Twice FA Cup runners-up, Palace have never won a major trophy in their 119-year history. The Eagles sense this may finally be their time up against a City side far from their former glories of Guardiola’s trophy-laden reign. Palace warmed up for the Wembley showpiece by cruising to a 2-0 win at Tottenham last weekend to equal their record of 49 Premier League points with two games of the season to spare. The south London club finished in the top 10 for the first time in the Premier League era last season after just a few months under Oliver Glasner. Another top-half finish looks unlikely, but progress has continued under the Austrian thanks to their FA Cup heroics, including a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Champions League quarterfinalists Aston Villa in the last four. How @CPFC reached the #EmiratesFACup Final 🦅 pic.twitter.com/w81rxlyzdZ — Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) May 16, 2025  Eberechi Eze is the main man for City to fear with five goals in his last four games. But he is one of just four England internationals that reached the final of Euro 2024 likely to start for Palace on Saturday alongside Dean Henderson, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton. “It means everything,” said Eze on the prospect of delivering the club’s first taste of silverware. “We know what it means to the fans, to the club. We’re going to give everything that we’ve got to put ourselves in the best position. “We’re confident. We know that we’ve just got to do what we do and be the best version of ourselves, and we’ve got the chance of beating any team.” Victory would also secure entry to one of Europe’s major club competitions for the first time in Palace’s history, with a place in the Europa League at stake. City’s laboured display in drawing a blank at bottom-of-the-table Southampton last weekend gives Palace even more reason to believe they can lift the cup. However, Guardiola’s men are unbeaten in 10 games, including a 5-2 demolition of Palace in the Premier League last month despite falling 2-0 behind. City’s fightback at the Etihad Stadium in the last encounter between the clubs was prompted by Kevin De Bruyne rolling back the years. The Belgian has just three games left as a City player after a glorious decade in Manchester and will be aiming to add one more to his 14 major honours with the club. “He has had an incredible time at Manchester City,” said City’s top scorer Erling Haaland. “It is ridiculous how many trophies he has won. Hopefully he will get one more trophy.” Manchester City’s road to the #EmiratesFACup Final 🩵 pic.twitter.com/SJuPAXbyyE — Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) May 14, 2025  After an unprecedented four consecutive English top-flight titles, City find themselves battling just to secure a top-five Premier League finish and a place in next season’s Champions League. Anything other than victory would cap what Haaland described as a “horrendous” campaign for a squad of serial winners. City have not ended a season without a trophy since Guardiola’s first at the club in 2016/17. “It is a good habit to reach Wembley and always important to win trophies. We have the FA Cup final to play for and in a horrific season we still managed to do this,” added the Norwegian. Palace’s extraordinary and eventually heartbreaking 1990 campaign was their finest hour in the competition. The semifinals and final(s) that year were arguably the most dramatic in the competition’s long and storied history and remain the emotional high and low point of every Palace fan who watched them. Palace were struggling in the top flight after promotion and had been humiliated 9-0 by Liverpool early in the season. In the Cup they were hardly pulling up trees either, beating lower league Portsmouth, Huddersfield Town, Rochdale and Cambridge United to reach the semifinals for the first time since they lost to Southampton as a third division team in 1976. Facing runaway champions-elect and FA Cup holders Liverpool again in the semis look an insurmountable barrier and an Ian Rush goal had the Reds ahead at halftime at Villa Park. Things then went crazy as Mark Bright and Gary O’Reilly gave Palace a shock lead. Two goals in two minutes put Liverpool back in front, only for Andy Gray to stun the odds-on favourites in the 88th minute to force extra time. Amazingly, it was Palace who snatched victory in the 109th minute via Alan Pardew, who would later manage the club. The cup final itself, against Manchester United, went to a replay after a stunning 3-3 draw in the first encounter. United won the next match 1-0 with a goal from defender Lee Martin, which handed a young manager by the name of Alex Ferguson his first trophy as boss of the Red Devils. City are seven-time winners of the cup, with their first victory coming in 1904 against Bolton Wanderers. Their last win was a 2-1 victory against their fierce rivals Manchester United in 2023. This is the 74th meeting between the two teams in a fixture dating back to 1921. Palace were 2-0 winners in an FA Cup meeting in the third round that year. City stormed back in the next meeting between the clubs – once again in the FA Cup – beating Palace 11-4 in February 1926. Overall, City have claimed the spoils on 39 occasions and the Eagles soaring to victory after 17 of the meetings. Palace haven’t recorded a win in their last seven encounters with City, who have won four in that time. Haaland is expected to start after making his comeback from six weeks out injured at Southampton last weekend. Rodri continues his slow return to full fitness, but with an eye on the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup in June, the cup final appears to have come too soon for a start. Midfielder Adam Wharton has returned to full fitness following an ankle injury. It means the Eagles have a fully fit squad to choose from.

Doha, Qatar – Reigning men’s javelin world champion and Olympic silver medallist Neeraj Chopra is set to get his 2025 athletics season under way at World Athletics’ Doha Diamond League event in Qatar on Friday. The two-time Olympic medal-winning Indian athlete – gold at Tokyo 2021 and silver at Paris 2024 – walks into the new season following a stressful few weeks at home. From facing social media backlash for inviting Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem to the inaugural Neeraj Chopra Classic javelin event, to publicly pledging his support for the Indian armed forces amidst their near full-fledged war against Pakistan and dealing with the weight of expectations on the field – Chopra says he’s happy to get back on the field. In this brief chat with Al Jazeera, the 27-year-old star spills his thoughts on the mental pressure of being a high-profile athlete in India, the boon and bane of social media, and the upcoming athletics season. Al Jazeera: How do you deal with the mental pressure of being a high-profile athlete and celebrity in a sport-mad country like India?Neeraj Chopra: The ability to win medals for my country is a matter of great pride for me and, to some extent, it takes care of some of the pressure. As long as I focus on my tasks and challenges on the field, I am able to overcome the mental challenges. I mostly train outside India, sometimes in South Africa during off-season and in Europe during the competition season. When I go back to India I have to live up to my public image and act in a certain way, especially for sponsorship deals, and I don’t enjoy it very much. Initially, after my success at the Tokyo Games, it was difficult but with time and the help of some of the experienced athletes, I have learned to deal with it. Al Jazeera: Is social media to be blamed for some of this pressure?
Chopra: Social media has given everyone with a phone and an internet connection the platform and freedom to say whatever they like and attack whomever they want. Some people take to social media to vent their pent-up frustrations. If they are facing any issues in their personal lives that can’t be aired, they take aim at people on social media. However, I try not to worry about such comments and focus on my work. Al Jazeera: Have there been instances where you’ve felt the need to quit social media and, if it comes down to it, would you be able to go off it?
Chopra: Of course. I can quit social media in a heartbeat if I want to. I never feel obligated to maintain a presence. I am there to share my journey, promote the sport and create a pathway for other athletes from my country. I want to show what goes behind becoming an international athlete. I am not an influencer, I am an athlete. Javelin is my career, not social media. I can quit social media very easily. Al Jazeera: You and Arshad Nadeem have flipped the script on a mostly European-centric sport by winning back-to-back Olympic medals in javelin, but will this success translate into the growth of track and field sports in the South Asian region?
Chopra: Honestly, up until a few years ago I didn’t I see a great future for athletics in India and couldn’t find a way to take it to the masses. Now, however, I am beginning to see a change. For instance, for the first time, four Indian athletes are part of the Doha Diamond League meet this year and that’s a great sign. I’m ecstatic. It means people are sitting up and taking notice. Javelin has slowly become a global event and is not restricted to European athletes any more. My competition, the Neeraj Chopra Classic, is a step in the same direction. I want to use it as a platform to showcase the sport to Indian masses and help it grow. Al Jazeera: The Doha Diamond League is where your season is about to get under way. You have an Olympic silver medal under your belt, but your World Athletics Championship title will be on the line this year. How do you feel about 2025?
Chopra: I’m ready and excited to get things going. I have a new coach, former Olympic gold medallist Jan Zelezny, who has helped me make minor changes to my routine. It took some time to adjust to the changes but I feel great. I have been troubled by some groin issues but it’s all in the past now. I can’t wait to start the new season. Al Jazeera: Your fans have been willing you on to break the 90-metre barrier for some time now. Does that pressure get to you and do you think this will be the year to surpass 90m?
Chopra: I feel reinvigorated and am in great shape physically. In addition to the physical aspect, Zelezny has also passed on tips that help me deal with the mental part of being an athlete. It helps keeps the pressure at bay. I have been training and performing consistently, which forms the basis of achieving the best results on the field. No one can predict what will happen on the day of the competition but I am always looking to go beyond my previous best. Several javelin athletes have thrown their personal best in Doha and I aim to do the same on Friday.

"sports","Nuggets and Thunder set up winner-take-all NBA showdown in Game 7","16 May 2025",NA,"Julian Strawther provides the spark off the bench, and even loses a tooth, as Nuggets force Game 7 against Thunder. Now this was finally a role Julian Strawther could sink his teeth into, even if it cost him one. Playing meaningful extended minutes for the first time in the series, the Denver Nuggets guard provided a spark off the bench as he scored all 15 of his points in the second half on Thursday night. His big game helped propel Denver to a 119-107 victory over the Thunder and force a Game 7 on Sunday in Oklahoma City. “That’s the moment you dream of when you’re a little kid – come to the game, having all the guys believe in you, find you in your spots and be able to just make an impact on the game,” said Strawther, a second-year player out of Gonzaga. Strawther certainly left it all on the floor, including a tooth (a prosthetic one) that happened to pop out in the fourth quarter when he took contact from an Oklahoma City player. He tried to get the officials to stop play long enough to gather it up. But the action was already heading the other way. A ball boy scooped it up for him in a towel and returned it to the bench. By the time Strawther addressed the media following the game, he had it back in place. He explained that after he lost a baby tooth as a kid, the adult version – located on the right side next to his front tooth – never grew in. “We got it back,” Strawther said. Just like that, the Nuggets are going back to OKC. It was their sole mission after frittering away a fourth-quarter lead and losing there in Game 5. The Nuggets’ bench made a big impact behind the play of Strawther, Russell Westbrook (eight points) and Peyton Watson (four). Sure, the reserves of the Thunder outscored them 32-27. Before Thursday, though, the average production of the bench was 34-22 through five games in favour of the Thunder. “(Julian) was amazing,” said Nikola Jokic, who had 29 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists. “He had the big points, the big moments of the game.” Strawther finished 3 of 4 from 3-point range and 4 of 4 from the line. Above all, he helped the Nuggets maintain their momentum in the fourth quarter as Jokic sat on the bench to get some valuable rest. Strawther played 19 1/2 minutes, his playoff high. This after being limited to 14 minutes combined over the last three games, including a “DNP” – did not play – in Game 3. Interim coach David Adelman told him to stay ready. He listened. “Understanding that there’s a night that I may not check in at all,” Strawther explained. “And there’s a night like tonight where he’s going to ride with me. “Me and (Adelman) have had a transparent relationship through these playoffs, and I’m really appreciative for him throwing me out there tonight.” His role may increase even more depending on the status of Aaron Gordon, who hurt his left hamstring late in the game. “I feel OK. We’ll see,” Gordon said after the game. “I’m going to start the recovery process now, to make sure I’m ready for a Game 7.” Another player who found a groove was banged-up forward Michael Porter Jr., who was 4 of 9 for 10 points. He’s been dealing with a sprained left shoulder. “For me, with what I’ve been through, there’s so much extra things I have to be on top of,” explained Porter, who said he had a lidocaine injection in his shoulder before Game 6 and plans to have another leading into Sunday. “Since I hurt my shoulder I’m not able to be on top of things like I want to … I don’t feel as comfortable and confident in my shot as I want to feel throughout these playoffs. “But I’m still out there and still trying to space the floor and shooting it when I’m getting it, whether it goes in or out. I just have to stay confident.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/16/nuggets-and-thunder-set-up-winner-take-all-nba-showdown-in-game-7"
"science_tech","Could AI help elderly people and refugees reconstruct unrecorded pasts?","18 May 2025","Anna Pivovarchuk","A child catches a glimpse of her father in one of Franco’s prisons, another sees a locomotive for the first time – how artificial intelligence is being used to create ‘synthetic memories’. In 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis in Europe, as a record 1.3 million people, mostly Syrians fleeing civil war, sought asylum, Pau Aleikum Garcia was in Athens, helping those arriving in the Greek capital after a perilous sea journey. The then 25-year-old Spanish volunteer arranged housing for refugees in abandoned facilities like schools and libraries, and set up community kitchens, language classes and art activities.     “It was kind of a massive cascade of people,” Garcia recalls. “My own memory of that time is oddly patchy,” he admits. Though there was one encounter that stood out. In one of those schools in Athens’ Exarcheia neighbourhood, where refugees painted the external wall to illustrate their memories of their journeys, Garcia met a Syrian woman in her late 70s. “I’m not afraid of being a refugee. I have lived all my life. I’m happy with what I have lived,” he recalls her telling him. “I’m afraid that my grandkids will be refugees for all their life.” When he tried to reassure her that they would find a place to start anew, she protested: “No, no, I’m worried, because when my grandkids grow [up] and they ask themselves, ‘Where do I come from?’ they won’t be able to answer that question.” The woman told him how, during the family’s journey to Greece, all but one of their photo albums were lost. Now, she said, all the memories of their lives in Syria existed only in her and her husband’s minds, unrecorded and unrecoverable for the next generation. The woman’s story stayed with Garcia after he returned to Barcelona and his work as cofounder of the design studio, Domestic Data Streamers (DDS). Over the years, the studio has grown into a 30-person team of experts in varied disciplines such as psychology, architecture, cognitive science, journalism and design. The studio has collaborated with diverse institutions such as museums, prisons and churches, as well as the likes of the United Nations, and uses technology to bring “emotions and humanity” to data visualisation. Then, in around 2019, with the rise of generative artificial intelligence – a model of machine learning that uses algorithms to create new content from data scraped from the internet – the team began to explore image-generating technology, following the release of ChatGPT. As they did, Garcia thought of the grandmother from Syria and how this technology might help someone like her by constructing images based on memories. He believes that memories – captured through records like photographs – play an integral role in connecting generations. “Memories are the architects of who we are. … It’s a big part of how social identities are built,” he says. He also likes to cite Montserrat Roig, a Catalan author, who wrote that the biggest act of love is to remember something. But in the past, people had fewer opportunities to document their lives than their mobile phone-wielding contemporaries, he says. Many experiences have been omitted or erased from collective memory due to lack of access, persecution, censorship or marginalisation. So with this in mind, in 2022, Garcia and his team launched the Synthetic Memories project to use AI to generate photographic representations of memories that were lost, due to missing photos, for instance, or never recorded in the first place. “I don’t think there was an eureka moment,” Garcia says of the evolution of the idea. “I’ve always been intrigued by how documentaries reconstruct the past … our goal and approach were more focused on the subjective and personal side, trying to capture the emotional layers of memory.” For Garcia, the chance to recover such memories is an important act in reclaiming one’s past. “The fact that you have an image that tells this happened to me, this is my memory, and this is shown and other people can see it, is also a way to say to you, ‘Yes, this happened’. It’s a way of saying, of having more dignity about the part of your history that has not been depicted.” To create a synthetic memory, DDS uses open-source image-generating AI systems such as DALL-E 2 and Flux, while the team is developing its own tool. The process starts with an interviewer asking a subject to recall their earliest memory. They explore various narratives as people recount their life stories before picking the one they think can be best encapsulated in an image. The interviewer works with a prompter – someone trained in the syntax that the AI uses to create visuals – who inputs specific words to build the image from the details described by the interviewee. Nearly everything, such as hairstyles, clothing, and furniture, is recreated as accurately as possible. However, figures themselves are usually depicted from behind or, if faces are shown, with a degree of blurriness. This is intentional. “We want to be very clear that this is a synthetic memory and this is not real photography,” says Garcia. This is partly because they want to ensure their generated images don’t add to the proliferation of fake photos on the internet. The resulting images – usually two or three from each session, which can last up to an hour – can appear dreamlike and undefined. “As we know, memory is very, very, very fragile and full of imperfections,” Garcia explains. “That was the other reason why we wanted a model that could be full of imperfections and also a bit fragile, so it’s a good demonstration of how our memory works.” Garcia’s team found that people who took part in the project said they felt a stronger connection to less detailed images, their suggestive nature allowing for their imagination to fill in the blanks. The higher the resolution, the more someone focuses on the details, losing that emotional connection to the image, Airi Dordas, the project’s lead, explains. The team first trialled this technology with their grandparents. The experience was moving, Garcia says, and one that grew into medical trials to determine whether synthetic memories can be used as an augmentation tool in reminiscence therapy for dementia sufferers. From there, the team went on to work with Bolivian and Korean communities in Brazil to tell their stories of migration, before partnering with Barcelona’s city council to document local memories. The sessions were open to the public and held last summer at the Design Museum in Barcelona, generating more than 300 memories. Some wanted to work through traumatic experiences, like one woman who was abused by a relative who avoided jail and wanted to recreate a memory of him in court to share with her family. Others recalled moments from their childhood, like 105-year-old Pepita, who recreated the day she saw a train for the first time. Couples came to relive shared experiences. There was always a moment, Ainoa Pubill Unzeta, who carried out interviews in Barcelona, says, “when people actually saw a picture that they would relate to, you could feel it … you can see it”. For some, it was just a smile; others cried. For her, this was confirmation that the image was done well. One of the first memories Garcia recorded during their pilot sessions was that of Carmen, now in her 90s. She remembers going up to a stranger’s balcony as a child, her mother having paid the owners to let them in, because it looked into the courtyard of the jail where her father, a doctor for the Republican front during the Spanish Civil War, was being held. This was the only way the family could see him from his cell window. By incredible coincidence, Carmen’s son was employed in the same prison as a social worker decades later, but neither son nor mother knew that. When the whole family came to see an installation at the Public Office of Synthetic Memories last year, her son recognised the prison immediately from his mother’s reconstruction. “It was a kind of closing the loop … it was beautiful,” Garcia says. The team was particularly interested in telling stories of civic activists who have played a key role in different social movements in the city over the last 50 years, including those concerning LGBTQ and workers’ rights. While initially the focus was not on the dictatorship era, it “naturally brought us to engage with people who, by the historical circumstances, were activists against the regime,” Dordas explains. One of them was 74-year-old Jose Carles Vallejo Calderon. Born in Barcelona in 1950 to Republican parents who faced oppression under General Francisco Franco, Vallejo came of age during one of Europe’s longest dictatorships, which lasted from 1939 to 1975. During the civil war of 1936-39, and following the defeat of the Republican forces by Franco’s Nationalists, enforced disappearances, forced labour, torture and extrajudicial killings claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people. Vallejo became involved in opposition to the fascist regime first at university, where he attempted to organise a democratic student union, and then as a young worker at Barcelona’s SEAT automobile factory. He recalls an atmosphere of fear, with most people terrified of speaking out against the authoritarian government. “That fear sprang from the terrible defeat in the Spanish Civil War and from the many deaths that occurred during the war, but also from the harsh repression from the post-war period up to the end of the dictatorship,” he explains. Informants were everywhere, and the circle of trusted individuals was small. “As you can imagine, this is no way to live – this was living in darkness, silence, fear, and repression,” Vallejo says. “There were few of us – very few – who dared to move from silence to activism, which involved many risks.” Vallejo was imprisoned in 1970 for attempting to set up a labour union among SEAT employees, spending half a year in jail, including 20 days being tortured by Barcelona’s secret police. After another arrest in late 1971 and the prosecution demanding 20 years for what were then considered crimes of association, organisation and propaganda, Vallejo crossed the border with France in January 1972. He ultimately gained political asylum in Italy, where he lived in exile before returning to Spain following the first limited amnesty of 1976, which granted pardons to political prisoners after Franco’s death in 1975. Today, Vallejo dedicates his time to human rights activism. He presides over the Catalan Association of Former Political Prisoners of Francoism, created in the final years of the dictatorship. He learned about synthetic memories through Iridia, a human rights organisation that collaborated with DDS to help visualise memories of police abuse victims during the regime in a central Barcelona police station. Vallejo was drawn to the project, curious about how the technology might be applied to capturing resistance activities too dangerous to record during Franco’s rule. In 1970, SEAT workers organised clandestine breakfasts in the woods of Vallvidrera. On Sunday mornings, disguised as hikers, they would make their way through the dense forests surrounding the Catalan capital to discuss the struggle against the dictatorship. “I think I must have been to more than 10 or 15 of these forest gatherings,” Vallejo recalls. Other times, they met in churches. No records of these exist. Vallejo’s synthetic memory of these meetings is in black and white. The image is vague, almost like someone has taken an eraser to it to blur the details. But it is still possible to make out the scene: a crowd of people gathered in a forest. Some sit, others stand beneath a canopy of trees. Looking at the image, Vallejo says he felt transported to the clandestine assemblies in the Barcelona woods, where as many as 50 or 60 people would gather in a tense atmosphere. “I found myself truly immersed in the image,” he says. “It was like entering a kind of time tunnel,” he adds. Vallejo suffered memory loss around the ordeal of his arrests, imprisonment and torture. The process of creating the image provided “a feeling – not exactly of relief – but rather of reconciling memory with the past and perhaps also of filling that void created by selective amnesia, which results from complicated, traumatic, and above all, distant experiences”. He found the reconstruction a “valuable experience” that helped him process some of these events. Emphasising that memory is subjective, Garcia says, “One of the things that we are kind of drawing a very big red line about is historical reconstruction.” This is partly due to the drawbacks of AI, which reinforces cultural and other biases in the data it draws from. David Leslie, director of ethics and responsible innovation research at the Alan Turing Institute, the United Kingdom centre for data science and AI, cautions that using data that was initially biased against marginalised groups could create revisionist histories or false memories for those communities. Nor can “simply generating something from AI” help to remedy or reclaim historical narratives, he insists. For DDS, “It is never about the bigger story. We are not reconstructing the past,” Garcia explains. “When we talk about history, we talk about one truth that somehow we are committed to,” he elaborates. But while synthetic memories can depict a part of the human experience that history books cannot, these memories come from the individual, not necessarily what transpired, he underlines. The team believes synthetic memories could not only help communities whose memories are at risk but also create dialogue between cultures and generations. They plan to set up “emergency” memory clinics in places where cultural heritage is in danger of being eroded by natural disasters, such as in southern Brazil, which was last year hit by floods. There are also hopes to make their finished tool freely available to nursing homes. But Garcia wonders what place the project could have in a future where there is an “over-registration” of everything that happens. “I have 10 images of my father when he was a kid,” he says. “I have over 200 when I was a kid. But my friend, of her daughter, [has] 25,000, and she’s five years old!” “I think the problem of memory image will be another one, which will be that we are … [overwhelmed] and we cannot find the right image to tell us the story,” he muses. Yet in the present moment, Vallejo believes the project has a role to play in helping younger generations understand past injustices. Forgetting serves no purpose for activists like himself, he believes, while memory is like “a weapon for the future”. Instead of trying to numb the past, “I think it is more therapeutic – both collectively and individually – to remember rather than to forget.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/18/could-ai-help-elderly-people-and-refugees-reconstruct-their-unrecorded-pasts"

"science_tech","Pope Leo identifies AI as main challenge in first meeting with cardinals","10 May 2025",NA,"New pontiff sets out vision, pledging to continue ‘precious legacy’ of predecessor Pope Francis. Pope Leo XIV has held his first meeting with the world’s cardinals since his election as the head of the Catholic Church, identifying artificial intelligence (AI) as one of the most crucial issues facing humanity. Leo, the first American pope, laid out a vision of his papacy at the Vatican on Saturday, telling the cardinals who elected him that AI poses challenges to defending “human dignity, justice and labour” – a view shared with his predecessor, the late Pope Francis. Explaining his choice of name, the pontiff said he identified with the late Leo XIII, who had defended workers’ rights during his 1878-1903 papacy at the dawn of the industrial age, adding that “social teaching” was now needed in response to the modern-day revolution brought by AI. The late Pope Francis, who died last month, warned that AI risked turning human relations into mere algorithms and called for an international treaty to regulate it. Francis warned the Group of Seven industrialised nations last year that AI must remain human-centric, so that decisions about when to use weapons or even less-lethal tools would not fall to machines. In his speech, delivered in Italian, Pope Leo made repeated references to Francis and the mourning over his death, saying the late pontiff left a “precious legacy” and signalling that he would continue with his vision. Later on Saturday, Pope Leo made a surprise visit to a sanctuary south of Rome that is dedicated to the Madonna and of significance to his Augustinian order. People gathered in the town of Genazzano, in the square outside the main church housing the Madre del Buon Consiglio sanctuary, waiting for Leo to emerge. The pontiff shook hands and offered blessings to a few people in the crowd before entering the shrine. Leo previously visited the sanctuary, which is managed by Augustinian friars, last year, when he was a cardinal. It has been a place of pilgrimage since the 15th century.    Francis was pope for 12 years and often garnered criticism from conservative cardinals, who said he was watering down the Church’s doctrine on issues such as the inclusion of LGBTQ Catholics and women’s leadership. Leo, the former US Cardinal Robert Prevost, was a relative unknown on the global stage, before he was elected pontiff, who spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru before serving as a senior Vatican official. Saturday’s meeting took place in the same small Vatican auditorium where the cardinals had been gathering in the days before the conclave to discuss who should be the next pope. Czech Cardinal Dominik Duka was cited by the Reuters news agency as saying the situation of Catholics in communist China had been raised as an issue. The Vatican and China in 2018 signed a controversial deal on the appointment of bishops in the country, which gives Beijing some input into their selection. Conservatives have attacked the still-secret deal as a sellout, but Duka told Reuters it was necessary to keep dialogue open in places where the Church is oppressed.

French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are hosting a conference in Paris to attract United States-based academics and researchers in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s targeting of universities. European Union commissioners on Monday announced half a billion euros ($568m) in incentives to lure international academics to the continent at the Choose Europe for Science conference. The meeting at Paris’s Sorbonne University is targeted at academics and researchers who fear their work will be threatened by billions of dollars of US government spending cuts for universities and research bodies as well as attacks on higher education institutions over diversity policies and pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Pro-Palestinian foreign students in the US have been arrested and sent to detention centres, often without following due process, while universities have been pressured to punish professors speaking out against the Gaza war. Campaigners said the Trump administration’s actions, including revocations of permanent resident status of students, have a chilling effect on academic freedom – a cornerstone of the American education system. Trump’s campaign against universities has given Europe’s political leaders hope they could reap an intellectual windfall. Macron’s office said the EU is targeting researchers working in the fields of health, climate, biodiversity, artificial intelligence and space. For her part, von der Leyen said she wanted EU member states to invest 3 percent of their gross domestic products in research and development by 2030. US universities and research facilities have come under increasing political pressure under Trump, including threats of federal funding cuts. Trump has pushed universities to punish pro-Palestine protesters and ordered them to drop diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) measures aimed at providing better representation for minority and poorly served communities. Trump and his voter base have accused US universities of promoting progressive ideology over conservative values. They say the universities have failed to protect the civil rights of conservative and Jewish students. On April 14, Harvard University rejected a series of demands from the Trump administration. Within hours, the US Department of Education froze nearly $2.3bn in federal funding for the Ivy League institution. Last week, Trump renewed his threat to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status, a move that could cost the university billions of dollars if implemented. Harvard has described the president’s move as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making”. The university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has sued the administration. On March 10, the Department of Education announced it had sent letters to 60 higher education institutions, warning them of “enforcement actions” if they did not protect Jewish students on campus as stipulated in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. In February, the Trump administration froze $400m in funds for Columbia University in New York City, which emerged as the epicentre of last year’s protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. Some universities have also received “stop work” orders – calls to suspend research projects funded by the government. Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, said it had received more than 75 “stop work” orders from the US Department of Defense, according to a statement released by Cornell President Michael I Kotlikoff on April 8. Elsewhere, hundreds of international students and recent graduates have had their US visas revoked – some have even been arrested – for participating in pro-Palestine demonstrations. The Trump administration is also sharpening its attacks on the National Science Foundation, the government agency that funds basic science, maths and engineering research, especially at colleges and universities. On May 2, the White House made a preliminary budget request to cut $4.7bn, or more than half of the agency’s $9bn budget. It follows two previous waves of grant cancellations in April as well as funding cuts to other public bodies. In the wake of Trump’s moves, the EU is hoping to offer a political safe haven for US scientists and academics and also to “defend our [the EU’s] strategic interests and promote a universalist vision”, an official in Macron’s office told the AFP news agency. Monday’s conference in Paris is the latest push to open Europe’s doors to US-based researchers. In April, Macron appealed to US university staff to “choose France” and unveiled plans for a funding programme to cover the costs of bringing foreign scientists to the country. “We were quite indignant about what was happening, and we felt that our colleagues in the US were going through a catastrophe. … We wanted to offer some sort of scientific asylum to those whose research is being hindered,” Eric Berton, the president of France’s Aix-Marseille University, told the UK-based Guardian newspaper. The European Research Council, an EU body that finances scientific work, told the Reuters news agency that it would double its relocation budget to fund researchers moving to the EU to 2 million euros ($2.16m) per applicant. The UK government is preparing a similar initiative. Backed by about 50 million pounds ($66m) in state funding, the scheme is designed to support research grants and cover relocation expenses for select teams of scientists, mainly from the US. In Germany, as part of coalition talks for a new government, conservatives and Social Democrats have drawn up plans to lure up to 1,000 researchers, according to negotiation documents from March seen by Reuters that allude to the upheaval in US higher learning. “The American government is currently using brute force against the universities in the USA, so that researchers from America are now contacting Europe,” Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, said in April. “This is a huge opportunity for us.” For decades, Europe has lagged behind the US when it comes to investment in higher education. According to Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, total expenditures on research and development in the EU among businesses, governments and universities was 381 billion euros ($411bn) in 2023. That same year, total research and development in the US was estimated at $940bn, according to the National Centre for Science and Engineering Statistics, a federal data agency. And the wealthiest US university, Harvard, has an endowment worth $53.2bn while that of Britain’s (and Europe’s) wealthiest, the University of Oxford, is $10.74bn. “I don’t foresee a rapid build-up of additional scientific capability that could match what the US now has … for several decades,” Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University in New Jersey, recently told Reuters. Some US scientists have pointed to what they see as another drawback – European language barriers and unfamiliar laws and employment practices. In addition, research funding and researchers’ remuneration both lag far behind US levels. The Choose Europe for Science event is expected to counter those concerns by arguing that university pay gaps will seem less significant when the lower cost of education, healthcare and more generous social benefits are taken into account. Aix-Marseille University in the south of France said it has received interest from 120 researchers at institutions across the US, including NASA and Stanford University in California, in the 15-million-euro ($17m) “safe space for science” programme it launched on March 7. The initiative aims to attract US researchers from fields including health, medicine, epidemiology and climate change. In a letter to French universities in March, Philippe Baptiste, France’s minister for higher education and research, wrote: “Many well-known researchers are already questioning their future in the United States. We would naturally wish to welcome a certain number of them.” Elsewhere, the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, which specialises in climate change research, has created two fellowships for early career climate researchers from the US and has already seen an uptick in applications. An official from Macron’s office said Monday’s conference is being held “at a time when academic freedoms are retreating and under threat in a number of cases and Europe is a continent of attractiveness”. Still, Europe is not immune from controversy. Germany has been accused of silencing pro-Palestinian voices, having recently ordered the deportations of three European nationals and a US citizen over “anti-Semitic” actions.

The origins of heavy elements such as gold have been one of the biggest mysteries of astrophysics. A study has now provided a clue about the precious metal’s cosmic origins. Scientists have found that explosions in highly magnetised neutron stars, called magnetars, could have created gold in the universe. Here is more about the study: Analysis of archival data from space missions shows that a large amount of heavy metals, including gold, come from giant flares from magnetars, according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on April 29. Anirudh Patel, a doctoral student at the Department of Physics at Columbia University in New York, led the study, which used 20-year-old archival telescope data from NASA and European Space Agency telescopes to investigate how heavy elements such as iron and gold were created and distributed throughout the universe. “It’s a pretty fundamental question in terms of the origin of complex matter in the universe,” Patel was quoted as saying in an article on the NASA website. “It’s a fun puzzle that hasn’t actually been solved.” The authors estimated that magnetar giant flares could contribute up to 10 percent of the overall abundance of elements in the galaxy that are heavier than iron. Co-authors of the study are affiliated with Columbia University, Charles University in the Czech Republic, Louisiana State University, the Flatiron Institute in New York and Ohio State University. A magnetar is a type of neutron star that is highly magnetised, which means its magnetic field is extremely powerful. When a massive star explodes, it leaves a very dense, collapsed core behind, which is called a neutron star. Astronomers theorise that the first magnetars were formed after the first stars about 13.6 billion years ago, according to study coauthor Eric Burns, assistant professor and astrophysicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The Big Bang created the universe 13.8 billion years ago. On rare occasions, magnetars can release high-energy radiation by undergoing a “starquake”. Like an earthquake, a starquake can fracture the magnetar’s crust. Sometimes, magnetar starquakes bring with them a magnetar giant flare, a rare explosive event that releases gamma rays. The researchers found that magnetars release material during giant flares. However, they do not yet have a physical explanation for this. The researchers speculated about whether magnetar giant flares formed gold through the rapid process of neutrons forging lighter atomic nuclei into heavier ones. An element’s identity is defined by the number of protons it has. However, if an atom acquires an extra neutron, it can undergo nuclear decay, which can turn a neutron into a proton. A changed number of protons can change the element’s identity. Neutron stars have an extremely high density of neutrons. If a neutron star is disrupted, singular atoms can quickly capture a number of neutrons and undergo multiple decays. This leads to the formation of much heavier elements like uranium. Before this study, the creation of gold was attributed only to neutron star collisions, or kilonovas. When astronomers observed a neutron star collision in 2017 through telescopes, they found the collision could create heavy elements such as gold, platinum and lead. However, these collisions are believed to have happened relatively later in the history of the universe, in the past several billion years. However, the archival telescopic data, which was previously indecipherable, showed that magnetar giant flares formed much earlier. Hence, the study indicates that the first gold could have been made from magnetar giant flares. NASA has an upcoming mission that can follow up on these results. The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a gamma-ray telescope that is expected to launch in 2027. COSI will study energetic phenomena in the Milky Way and beyond, such as magnetar giant flares. According to the NASA website, COSI could identify individual elements created in the giant flares, helping to form a better understanding of the origin of the elements.

One of the world’s most endangered amphibians – the primordial and fish-like axolotl – has successfully adapted to a new environment after being released into artificial wetlands in Mexico, scientists say. In a study that provides hope for the survival of the Ambystoma mexicanuma, a creature that has been pushed to the brink of extinction by pollution and human activity, scientists recently released 18 captive-bred axolotls into two artificial wetlands close to Mexico City. Researchers fitted the smiley-face amphibians with trackers and found they were feeding at both sites. Lead researcher Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California told the BBC it was an “amazing result”. The findings were published in the journal PLoS One and suggest the axolotl can be successfully restored to its native habitat.    Legend has it that the axolotl was not always an amphibian. Long before it became Mexico’s most beloved salamander, it was believed to be the embodiment of the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl. While there are no official estimates on its current population, the species – which is endemic to central Mexico – was classed as “critically endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species in 2019. They breathe through their gills and skin, which allows them to adapt to their aquatic environment. They can also regenerate parts of their heart, spinal cord and brain. The salamander’s skin is typically dark although an albino variety can be bred. They can stay stock still for hours in their natural habitat, buried in mud to conserve energy and wait for prey. In their main stronghold, Lake Xochimilco, located in the southern part of Mexico City, axolotl numbers have plummeted by 99.5 percent in less than two decades. In 1998, researchers estimated there were 6,000 axolotls per square kilometre in Lake Xochimilco. By 2014, this number had dropped to just 36. Mexico is a biodiversity hotspot for amphibians and reptiles owing to its unique and varied habitats from tropical rainforests and deserts to cloud forests and temperate woodlands. The waters of Xochimilco, once used for traditional farming and flushed with spring water from the mountains, used to teem with large, smiley-faced axolotls. But pollution from Mexico City’s expanding urban sprawl has damaged the water quality of the city’s canals, which flow into the lakes. Furthermore, rainbow trout, which have escaped from nearby farms, have displaced axolotls in lakes around the capital and eaten their food. Researchers have also found that increasing numbers of axolotls have died from chytrid fungus, a skin-eating disease causing a catastrophic reduction in amphibian numbers in other parts of the world from Europe to Australia. The fungus has also been found in Mexico although it is not yet a major problem. Climate change is another factor threatening the axolotl as even small shifts in temperature and rainfall can disrupt ecosystems and erode biodiversity. In 2013, scientists voiced fears that they might disappear altogether by 2025. The axolotl isn’t the only species in Mexico facing an uncertain future. The pine forest stream frog, the clarion night snake and the Mexican alligator lizard are some of the other species that are also critically endangered.    To lay the foundations for the rewilding project, researchers meticulously monitored the ecology of the axolotls to establish their ideal living conditions. Then they worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland “refuges”, or artificial wetlands, near Xochimilco by installing natural filtering systems to clean the water. The scientists then released the amphibians into two types of wetland environments: restored natural wetlands and the artificial wetlands designed specifically for conservation purposes. These environments differ in their ecological structure, water chemistry and temperatures, variables that are critical determinants of amphibian physiology and behaviour. The axolotls were tagged with radio tracking devices to keep tabs on the amphibians. One of the key findings from the study was the axolotls’ ability to navigate and inhabit both artificial and restored wetland ecosystems effectively. While biologists and officials have led efforts to save the species and its habitat from extinction, a parallel, unexpected preservation phenomenon has emerged in recent years as the creature has benefitted from an unexpected resurgence of interest. The axolotl attracted international attention after the Minecraft computer game added the creature in 2021. That same year, the Bank of Mexico also decided to print an image of the animal on the 50-peso bill. Axolotls can now be spotted all over Mexico on murals, clothing and as children’s toys. Some bakeries have caused a sensation with their axolotl-shaped cakes and biscuits. “If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,” co-lead researcher Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico told the BBC. Climate change, habitat loss and outbreaks of disease have taken their toll on amphibians around the world. Half of all amphibian species are in decline while a third are threatened with extinction. The team overseeing the axolotl study said public funding is key to preventing the loss of other species as well. Over his six-year term, however, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was in office from 2018 to 2024, reduced funding to the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources by 35 percent. While scientists involved in the project hope to restore the axolotl’s population, they also highlighted the need for government, business and individual engagement. “Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,” Ramos said. “And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done. They just need a lot of people.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/1/can-mexico-bring-back-the-endangered-axolotl"
"science_tech","Have scientists discovered a new colour called ‘olo’?","26 Apr 2025","Sarah Shamim","Described as a ‘deeply saturated teal’ colour, humans can only see it with the help of laser technology. A team of scientists claims to have discovered a new colour that humans cannot see without the help of technology. The researchers based in the United States said they were able to “experience” the colour, which they named “olo”, by firing laser pulses into their eyes using a device named after the Wizard of Oz.     Olo cannot be seen with the naked eye, but the five people who have seen it describe it as being similar to teal. Professors from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Washington School of Medicine published an article in the journal, Science Advances, on April 18 in which they put forth their discovery of a hue beyond the gamut of human vision. They explained that they had devised a technique called Oz, which can “trick” the human eye into seeing olo. The technique is named after the Wizard of Oz. In the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900, Frank Baum wrote about a man who uses tricks to fool the residents of the fictional land of Oz into thinking he’s a wizard. For instance, it is believed that the Emerald City, the capital of Oz, is so bright and vibrant that visitors have to wear special glasses to protect their eyes. The glasses are one of the wizard’s tricks, since they make the city appear greener and grander. The human eye perceives colour via three types of photoreceptor or “cone cells” in the retina. S cones pick up shorter, blue wavelengths of light; M cones detect medium, green wavelengths; and L cones detect longer, red wavelengths. “The signals from these cones are then sent through a complex series of cells in the retina that act to clean up and integrate the signal before passing it down the optic nerve through parts of the brain,” Francis Windram, a research associate at the department of life sciences at Imperial College London, told Al Jazeera. The part of the brain that the visual information is passed to is the visual cortex. In normal vision, the function of M cones overlaps with the neighbouring S and L cones, so any light that stimulates M cones also activates the other two cones. The M cones don’t function alone. “There’s no wavelength in the world that can stimulate only the M cone,” Ren Ng, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley, explained in an article published on its website. “I began wondering what it would look like if you could just stimulate all the M cone cells. Would it be like the greenest green you’ve ever seen?” So Ng teamed up with Austin Roorda, one of the creators of the Oz technology and a professor of optometry and vision science at UC Berkeley. Oz, which Roorda described as “a microscope for looking at the retina”, uses tiny microdoses of laser light to target individual photoreceptors in the eye. The equipment, which must be highly stabilised during use, is already being used to study eye disease. The work using Oz began in 2018 by James Carl Fong, a doctoral student in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. Hannah Doyle, another doctoral student at Berkeley, ran the experiments through which human subjects were able to see the new colour, olo. The shade of olo has always existed, it just falls beyond the spectrum of shades visible to the human eye. There are other such shades that we cannot see. Hence, olo is not a new colour that has come into existence, from a physical or scientific perspective. However, “from a sociolinguistic perspective, if people give new names to colours which previously were indistinguishable thanks to this technology, then maybe! It all depends on how you say it,” Windram said. Five people have seen the “new” colour – four men and one woman. All had normal colour vision. Three of the subjects, including Roorda and Ng, are the co-authors of the research paper while the other two are members of the participating lab at the University of Washington and were unaware of the purpose of the study before they took part. Those who have seen olo describe it as a teal or green-blue colour – but one they had never seen before. In the article by UC Berkeley, it is described as a “blue-green colour of unparalleled saturation”. “It was like a profoundly saturated teal … the most saturated natural colour was just pale by comparison,” Roorda said. “I wasn’t a subject for this paper, but I’ve seen olo since, and it’s very striking. You know you’re looking at something very blue-green,” Doyle said. The researchers said an image of a teal square is the closest colour match to olo. However, this square is not an olo-coloured square. The naked human eye simply cannot see the shade. “If you start with the colour in that picture, and imagine dialling up the saturation further you would get to the teal of real peacock feathers, further still would be a laser in the teal wavelength, and far beyond that is olo, outside the natural space of human colors,” Ng told Al Jazeera. “We’re not going to see olo on any smartphone displays or any TVs any time soon. And this is very, very far beyond VR headset technology,” Ng said, according to a report in the UK’s Guardian newspaper. Berkeley researchers are exploring whether the Oz technology could help people with colour blindness. “We are now studying the science of boosting the colour dimensionality of signals going from the eye to the brain,” Ng said. “If it proves possible for a colour blind person to see full colour, the next question is whether a person with full colour could be boosted to yet a higher dimension of colour called tetrachromacy.” This could contain colours beyond the rainbow that would need new names. Ng said that this is part of an ongoing scientific inquiry. Windram said success would depend on the cause of colourblindness in individuals. Deuteranomaly, which causes decreased sensitivity to green light, is the most common form of colour blindness. “In this case, a miniaturised version of this technology could theoretically be used to correct this by directly stimulating the cones when the correct colour of light hits them,” Windram said. Windram pointed out that publicity materials for the research show images of the Oz experiment on a highly stabilised table. “This would require a lot of work to miniaturise the technology, and is likely a long way off. Given that the laser must stably hit the correct cones in order to stimulate them, this may not really be feasible as a form of vision correction technologically,” he said. The concept of a colour has three main components, Windram explained: The physical, which has to do with the wavelengths of light that meet the eye; the neurological, which refers to how humans biologically process these light signals; and the societal or linguistic component, which pertains to how colours are named. “In the end I may see a colour and call it ‘red’, someone else may call it ‘rot’ or ‘rouge’ … but also another may look at it a bit more closely and say ‘well it’s claret’ or ‘crimson’.” To test this, neuroscience and AI researcher Patrick Mineault developed a website for entertainment purposes in September 2024, on which users can take a test to see how their colour perception compares to others. Humans can also perceive colour differently due to differences in factors such as “temperature” of light. This was demonstrated when a photo of a dress went viral in 2015, dividing social media users over whether the dress was white and gold, or blue and black. Windram explained that people who were deciding what colours the dress was were drawing on preconceived notions of whether the photograph of the dress was taken in warm lighting or cool lighting. Yes, different species can experience colours differently. For example, humans process three wavelengths corresponding to red, blue and green light, while the mantis shrimp, a tiny crustacean, can visually perceive 12 channels of colour instead of three. An article by the Australian Academy of Science explains that the mantis shrimp can also detect ultraviolet and polarised light, which humans cannot see. However, while the human eye can mix two colours and perceive an in-between shade – such as purple as a mix of red and blue – the mantis shrimp’s eyes cannot mix colour receptors. Meanwhile, dogs only have two types of cones and can mostly only see shades of yellow and blue.

"science_tech","Humans outrun robots at Beijing half-marathon","19 Apr 2025",NA,"The humanoid robots were no match for human rivals as they made their half-marathon debut in the Chinese capital. Humans took the lead over robots and kept it easily as they raced to victory at Beijing’s Yizhuang half-marathon. Thousands of runners joined 21 humanoid robot rivals in a world-first 21km (13 miles, 352 yards) challenge in the Chinese capital on Saturday.     But not every bot was up to the task. One collapsed moments after the starting gun and lay motionless for minutes before regaining its feet. Another slammed into a barrier after only a few strides, taking its handler down with it. Some machines made it to the finish line but still trailed the humans badly. Tiangong Ultra, developed by the Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, clocked a time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The men’s winner finished more than an hour earlier. “Generally, these are interesting demonstrations,” said Alan Fern, a robotics professor at Oregon State University, “but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence.” “The robots are running very well, very stable… I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said He Sishu, a local AI engineer watching from the sidelines. Though technically in the race, the robots weren’t exactly autonomous athletes. Each one came with a team of engineers, and some needed physical support to stay upright. Chinese firms like DroidVP and Noetix Robotics fielded bots of all shapes and sizes, with a few even donning boxing gloves and headbands. Officials likened the event more to motorsport than a traditional race. Tang Jian, CTO at Tiangong’s lab, said they plan to shift focus to real-world tasks: “A focus going forward will be industrial applications … so they can truly enter factories, business scenarios, and finally households.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/4/19/humans-outrun-robots-at-beijing-half-marathon"
"science_tech","Is there life on another planet? Scientists find the strongest evidence yet","17 Apr 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","Near a planet far, far away, astronomers have found traces of chemicals that on Earth are only produced by living beings. Astronomers have found the clearest evidence yet that life might exist beyond the solar system, from the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years away from Earth, setting off rare excitement – tinged with caution – in the global scientific community. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers led by astronomers at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom have found chemical signatures of two compounds that on Earth are only produced by living creatures.     “These are the first hints we are seeing of an alien world that is possibly inhabited,” Nikku Madhusudhan, an astronomy professor at Cambridge and the lead researcher behind the discovery, told reporters at a media briefing on April 15. “This is a revolutionary moment.” So where is the planet that might possibly host life, what evidence have scientists found, and is there reason for scepticism? The researchers relied on data captured by NASA’s James Webb telescope, which was carried into outer space in 2022, and sits about 1.5 million kilometres (930,000 miles) away from Earth, as humanity’s watchtower peering into the universe. They focused on one particular planet, K2-18b, because it had already shown promising signs as a candidate extraterrestrial body with conditions similar to those on Earth. K2-18b lies in a constellation called Leo, and is so far away from Earth that a spaceship would need to travel for 124 years at the speed of light to get there. In reality, it would take much, much longer since the laws of physics don’t allow anything other than light to travel that fast. The planet is 8.6 times heavier than Earth, and 2.6 times as large. Critically, it sits in what is known as the “Goldilocks Zone” of its sun: that’s the region around a star where a planet’s temperature could, in theory, support water in its liquid form on the surface. In 2023, Cambridge astronomers found methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the planet. That was the first time that carbon-based molecules had been discovered in the atmosphere of any planet in the habitable zone of its sun – the distance from a sun where it’s neither too hot, nor too cold, and so possible for life to survive. The scientists said that a surface covered first by an ocean, and then a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, would explain the presence of carbon-based molecules. Simply put, it was possible that the planet could have water. Researchers have now found much harder evidence suggesting that the planet might not only have the conditions to host life – but could, at least in theory, be hosting life itself. To explore planets light years away from Earth, scientists wait for them to pass in front of their suns. They study the light from the suns as it streams through the atmospheres of these planets, searching for clues. That’s how the team found traces of either dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) – or both – in the atmosphere of K2-18b. On Earth, these compounds are only produced by living beings, particularly microbes such as marine phytoplankton. What’s more, what the scientists found suggests that the concentration of these chemicals in the K2-18b atmosphere was thousands of times higher than on Earth. “It was an incredible realisation seeing the results emerge and remain consistent throughout the extensive independent analyses and robustness tests,” said co-author Mans Holmberg, a researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, United States, in a media statement on the Cambridge University website. The scientists published their findings in the peer-reviewed Astrophysical Journal Letters publication, which means that other experts in the field who studied their paper found it convincing. But that does not mean that the scientists have found irrefutable evidence of life. Far from it. Madhusudhan acknowledged that it is possible that the traces of DMS and DMDS found in the atmosphere of K2-18b are the outcome of chemical phenomena that are as of now, unknown to humanity. “It’s important that we’re deeply sceptical of our own results, because it’s only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we’re confident in them,” Madhusudhan said. “That’s how science has to work.” His colleagues in the research team agreed. “Our work is the starting point for all the investigations that are now needed to confirm and understand the implications of these exciting findings,” said co-author Savvas Constantinou, also from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy. The findings of the Cambridge-led team follow a series of breakthroughs in recent years that have excited scientists about the possibilities of finding life beyond Earth. In 2011, NASA scientists announced that they had found chemicals that are components of DNA on meteorites that had landed in Antarctica. The chemical traces they had discovered couldn’t have been the result of contamination after the meteorites landed on Earth. The only explanation – that asteroids and comets could contain the building blocks of life. A year later, astronomers at Copenhagen University tracked down a sugar molecule in a distant star system. That molecule is an essential component of ribonucleic acid or RNA, a molecule that is critical for most biological functions. In 2023, astronomers found traces of organic molecules in the gases around one of Saturn’s moons, Enceladus. And in mid-2024, scientists identified five greenhouse gases that they said would be telltale signs of life on any other planet. But the journey of science is also about setbacks. In 2005, two NASA scientists claimed they had found potential traces of extraterrestrial life on Mars after they discovered signs of methane there. Yet those findings eventually did not hold up to scientific scrutiny and NASA distanced itself from their conclusions. The Cambridge-led team has found DMS and DMDS with 99.7 percent certainty. But while that might sound like a near-perfect score, it is far from what is accepted as the benchmark for a new discovery by the exacting standards of science. For their conclusions to be considered bulletproof, they need to get to what is known as the five-sigma threshold – 99.99994 percent certainty. The astronomers believe that more hours on the James Webb telescope could help them reach that level of confirmation. “Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,” said Madhusudhan. “This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we’re alone in the universe is one we’re capable of answering.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/17/is-there-life-on-another-planet-scientists-find-the-strongest-evidence-yet"

Here is all we know about Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi, the dire wolf pups. The dire wolf, a species that went extinct some 12,500 years ago but was made famous by the Game of Thrones series, has been brought back to life, according to Texas-based biotech firm Colossal Biosciences. The company has described the dire wolf as the “world’s first successfully de-extinct animal”.     On Monday, the company announced that its research had led to the birth of three pups — Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi. But the recently born wolves have DNA which is very close to that of the grey wolf, leading to criticism of the company’s claims. So are Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi truly dire wolves? Here is what we know about them: The dire wolf, the real-life inspiration behind the wolves in HBO’s Game of Thrones, was once a dominant predator across North America. Fossils suggest that dire wolves were built for strength, not speed. They had more muscle and a heavier build than other ancient or modern wolves. But despite their size, fossils show that the dire wolf could still move well through different environments, Colossal Biosciences said. It could hunt big animals and live alongside other species. Their powerful bodies made dire wolves strong predators. These carnivores hunted large Ice Age animals like bison, horses and possibly mammoths. As many of their prey species disappeared, likely in part due to human hunting, dire wolves may have been driven to extinction, paving the way for the grey wolf to move down from northern Canada and Alaska to take over its ecological role. SOUND ON. You’re hearing the first howl of a dire wolf in over 10,000 years. Meet Romulus and Remus—the world’s first de-extinct animals, born on October 1, 2024. The dire wolf has been extinct for over 10,000 years. These two wolves were brought back from extinction using… pic.twitter.com/wY4rdOVFRH — Colossal Biosciences® (@colossal) April 7, 2025  “Many people view dire wolves as mythical creatures that only exist in a fantasy world, but in reality, they have a rich history of contributing to the American ecosystem,” said Game of Thrones author George RR Martin, who is also an investor and cultural adviser to Colossal. “I get the luxury to write about magic, but [they] have created magic by bringing these majestic beasts back to our world.”    According to Colossal, at first glance, dire wolves — their formal, scientific name is Aenocyon dirus — appeared more heavily built, with thicker legs, broader heads and shoulders, a stockier frame, and a more pronounced snout. Although they look alike, dire wolves are not closely related to grey wolves and are not their ancestors. Genetic studies reveal that the two species diverged millions of years ago and evolved separately in the Americas.  Scientists extracted and sequenced DNA from two ancient dire wolf specimens — a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old ear bone. This analysis identified 20 key genetic differences between dire wolves and their closest living species, grey wolves. Using CRISPR technology, a kind of molecular scissors to cut DNA at a specific spot, researchers edited the genomes of grey wolf cells to incorporate these 20 specific genetic variants associated with dire wolf traits, such as larger size, broader heads and thicker fur. ​ The genetic material was inserted into an egg cell from a domestic dog. Once the embryos were developed, they were implanted into surrogate dogs. Sixty-two days later, the genetically engineered pups were born. Romulus and Remus, both males, were born on October 1, 2024, while Khaleesi, a female, was born on January 30, 2025. Romulus and Remus, at six months old, each measure nearly 4 feet (122cm) in length and weigh approximately 80 pounds (36kg), with projections to reach 6 feet (183cm) and 150 pounds (68kg) at full maturity. Khaleesi, at three months, is developing similarly. The wolves exhibit physical characteristics such as white coats, larger body sizes, and broader heads. When the first dire wolf pup was delivered by Caesarean section, Colossal’s chief animal officer, Matt James, recalled gently rubbing the newborn between two towels to stimulate its first breath. “Good lord, this thing is huge,” he remembered thinking. While Colossal Biosciences referred to these animals as “de-extincted” dire wolves on Monday, some experts argue that they are genetically modified grey wolves rather than true representations of the extinct species. “We call them dire wolves,” Ben Lamm, founder and CEO of the Dallas-based startup, said. Love Dalen, a professor in evolutionary genomics based at the Centre for Palaeogenetics at Stockholm University and adviser to Colossal, also argued this is more of a philosophical question. “There’s no secret that across the genome, this is 99.9 percent grey wolf. There is going to be an argument in the scientific community regarding how many genes need to be changed to make a dire wolf, but this is really a philosophical question,” Dalen said. “It carries dire wolf genes, and these genes make it look more like a dire wolf than anything we’ve seen in the last 13,000 years. And that is very cool,” he added. The two newly born baby Dire Wolves, brought back from extinction by genetic engineering, seated on the Iron Throne. 🐺 George R.R. Martin serves as a Colossal Biosciences cultural advisor and investor, with Peter Jackson loaning his Iron Throne prop for the photoshoot. pic.twitter.com/Yax9WjCp7a — westerosies (@westerosies) April 7, 2025  According to Colossal, the project helps push the boundaries of genetic engineering and could provide tools for conservation, especially for species with shrinking genetic pools. The dire wolf also served as a high-profile case to demonstrate these capabilities. “This project demonstrates the awesome potential for advances in genetic engineering and reproductive technologies to recreate lost diversity,” Andrew Pask, Colossal advisory board member, said. “This work underpins pioneering research that seeks to stabilise ecosystems to prevent further biodiversity losses and to create new methods to actually restore lost biodiversity,” he added.

Still, other experts argue that we may not yet understand the full implications of these changes. “We can’t protect what we already have,” said Dan Ashe, president and CEO of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in Canada, in an interview with the Toronto Star. So far, investors have committed $435m to the company, boosting its valuation to $10.2bn. Colossal plans to monitor the pups’ growth, health, and behaviour, and may pursue further projects, including de-extinction of other species like the woolly mammoth. The broader goal is to apply the tech to real-world conservation.

"opinions","Cheer up, people of Gaza! You’ll get killed on a full stomach","19 May 2025",NA,"The new US humanitarian plan will ‘save us’, just like the previous ones did. I was always told as a child that breakfast is the most important meal. It gives you the energy to keep going the whole day. And so, in my family, we would regularly eat a scrumptious breakfast. That was in the past, of course. For weeks now, we have had hardly anything to eat. I myself have been dreaming of having a slice of cheese and a warm loaf of bread dipped in thyme and oil.     Instead, I start yet another day of genocide with a cup of tea and a tasteless, nearly expired “not-for-sale WFP fortified biscuit”, which I bought for $1.50. I have been following the news recently and have started to feel that my wish for something other than a World Food Programme (WFP) biscuit may soon be fulfilled. Apparently, the United States has grown tired of hearing Palestinians in Gaza say they are starving. So now, it has decided to end the hunger, or at least the annoying complaints about it. And so, with unshakeable confidence and pride in its own ingenuity, the US government has announced a new mechanism for delivering food to Gaza. The “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation”, an extraordinary name now added to our genocide vocabulary of NGOs and charities, is supposedly set to restart food distribution by the end of May and hand out “300 million meals”. Israel, for its part, has volunteered to secure the “humanitarian” process, while maintaining its killing activities. While this new feeding “mechanism” is being set up, the Israeli government, “under US pressure”, announced that it will let in “a basic quantity of food” in order to prevent “the development of a hunger crisis”, international media reported. The resumption will reportedly last only a week. Here in Gaza, where the hunger crisis is already “well-developed”, we are hardly surprised by these announcements. We are well used to Israel – with foreign backing – turning on and off the “food button” as it pleases. For years, we have been kept in a 365-square-kilometre prison, where our Israeli jailers control our food, rationing it so that we can never go too far beyond the level of survival. Long before this genocide, they openly declared to the world that they were keeping us on a diet, our calories carefully counted to ensure we did not die but just suffer. This was not a fleeting penalty; it was an official government policy. Anyone driven by basic humanity who dared challenge the blockade from the outside was attacked, even killed. Some say we should have been grateful that trucks were being allowed to enter at all. True, they were. But just as often, they weren’t, especially when we, the prisoners, were deemed to have misbehaved. Countless times, I would find my neighbourhood bakery shut down because there was no cooking gas, or I would fail to find my favourite cheese because our jailers had decided it was a “dual-use” item and could not enter Gaza. We were good at growing our own food, but we could not do much of that either because much of our fertile soil was near the prison fence, and hence out of reach. We loved fishing, but that too was closely monitored and restricted. Venture beyond the shore and you would get shot. All of this humiliating, calculated blockade was taking place well before October 7, 2023. After that day, the amount of food allowed into Gaza was drastically reduced. In the days that followed, I felt the shackles of the Israeli blockade on Gaza more tangible than ever, even though I had lived under it since I was born. For the first time, I found myself struggling to secure something as basic as bread. I remember thinking: surely the world will not allow this to last. And yet here we are, 19 months later, 590 days in, the struggle has only gotten worse. On March 2, Israel banned all food and other aid from entering Gaza. The situation since then has grown from bad to worse, leaving us nostalgic for previous phases of the crisis, when the suffering felt slightly more bearable. A few weeks ago, for example, we could still have some tomatoes alongside our canned beans that rotted our stomachs. But now, vegetable vendors are nowhere to be found. Bakeries have also closed, and flour has all but disappeared, leaving me wishing to re-experience the slight disgust at the sight of worms squirming through infested flour because it would mean my mother could make bread again. Now, finding non-expired fava beans is all I could realistically wish for. I recognise that others still have it much worse than I do. For parents of young children, the struggle to find food is an agony. Take my barber, for example. When I last went to him for a haircut two weeks ago, he looked exhausted. “Can you imagine? I haven’t eaten bread in weeks. Whatever flour I manage to buy every few days, I save for my children. I eat just enough to survive, not to feel full. I just don’t understand why the world treats them like this. If we are not worthy of life in their eyes, then at least have mercy on our hungry children. It’s OK if they want to starve us — but not our children,” he told me. This may seem like a cruel sacrifice, but it is what parenting has become here after 19 months of nonstop Israeli killing. Parents are consumed by fear, not just for their children’s safety, but for the possibility that their children might be bombed while hungry. This is the nightmare of every household and every tent-hold in Gaza. In the few barely functioning hospitals, the landscape of famine is even more harrowing. Babies and children looking like skeletons lie on hospital beds; malnourished mothers sit by them. It has become normal to see daily images of emaciated Palestinian children. We may ourselves be struggling to find food, but seeing them leaves our hearts shattered. We want to help. We think maybe a can of peas might make a difference. But what can peas do for an infant suffering from marasmus, for a child who looks like a fragile shell of skin and bones? Meanwhile, the world sits in silence, watching Israel block aid and deliver bombs and asking questions in disbelief. On May 7, the Israeli army bombed al-Wehda Street, one of the busiest in Gaza City. One missile hit an intersection full of street vendors, another – a functioning restaurant. At least 33 Palestinians were killed. Images of a table with slices of pizza soaked in the blood of one of the victims appeared online. The scene of pizza in Gaza captivated world attention; the bloodbath did not. The world demanded answers: how can you be in a famine when you can order pizza? Yes, there are vendors and restaurants amid genocidal famine. Vendors that sell a kilogramme of flour for $25 and a can of beans for $3. A restaurant where the smallest and most expensive pizza slice in the world is served — a piece of bad-quality dough, cheese, and the blood of those who craved it. To this world, we are required to explain the presence of pizza in order to convince we are worthy of food. To this world, the outline of an abstract US plan to feed us sounds reasonable, all while tonnes of life-saving aid wait at the border crossings to be allowed in and distributed by already fully functional aid agencies. We in Gaza have seen PR exercises masked as “humanitarian action” before. We remember the airdrops that were killing more people than they were feeding. We remember the $230m pier that barely got 500 truckfuls of aid into Gaza from the sea: a feat that could have been accomplished in half a day via an open land crossing. We in Gaza are hungry, but we are no fools. We know that Israel can only starve and genocide us because the US allows it to. We know that stopping the genocide is not among Washington’s concerns. We know that we are hostages not just of Israel, but also of the US. What haunts us isn’t just famine; it is also the fear of outsiders arriving under the guise of aid, only to start laying the foundations of colonisation. Even if the US plan is enforced and even if we are allowed to eat before Israel’s next bombing, I know my people will not be broken by the weaponisation of food. Israel, the US, and the world should understand that we will not trade land for calories. We will liberate our homeland, even on an empty stomach.

"opinions","Project Esther and the weaponisation of Zionism","19 May 2025",NA,"A conservative project to allegedly counter anti-Semitism is using a pro-Israel stance to mask white nationalist goals. On October 7, 2024 – exactly one year into the United States-backed Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip that has now killed more than 53,000 Palestinians – the Washington-based Heritage Foundation unleashed a policy paper titled Project Esther: A National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism. The conservative think tank is the same force behind Project 2025, a blueprint for consolidating executive power in the US and forging the best-ever right-wing dystopia. The “national strategy” proposed by Project Esther – which is named for the biblical queen credited with saving the Jews from extermination in ancient Persia – basically consists of criminalising opposition to Israel’s current genocide and exterminating freedoms of speech and thought along with a whole lot of other rights.     The first “key takeaway” listed in the report is that “America’s virulently anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, and anti-American ‘pro-Palestinian movement’ is part of a global Hamas Support Network (HSN)”. Never mind that, in reality, there is no such thing as a “global Hamas Support Network” – just as there is no such thing as the HSN’s alleged “affiliated Hamas Support Organizations (HSOs)” that the Heritage Foundation has also taken the liberty of inventing. Among these alleged HSOs are prominent American Jewish organisations such as Jewish Voice for Peace. The second “key takeaway” of the report is that the so-called HSN is “supported by activists and funders dedicated to destroying capitalism and democracy” – a curious choice of terms, no doubt, from a think tank that is doing its best to eradicate what remains of US democracy as we speak. The phrase “capitalism and democracy” appears no fewer than five times in the report – although it’s not quite clear what Hamas has to do with capitalism aside from governing a Palestinian territory that has for more than 19 months been on the receiving end of billions upon billions of dollars’ worth of US-funded military destruction. From the perspective of the arms industry, at least, genocide is capitalism at its best. And as per the genocidal logic of Project Esther, protesting the mass slaughter of Palestinians is fundamentally anti-Semitic – hence the need to pursue the prescribed national strategy of “extirpating the influence of the HSN from our society”. The October publication of the Heritage Foundation report occurred on the watch of President Joe Biden’s administration, which the think tank diagnosed as “decidedly anti-Israel” despite its complete and utter complicity in the genocide in Gaza. The report included many suggestions on how to “combat the scourge of antisemitism in the United States … when a willing Administration occupies the White House”. Fast forward seven months, and a recent New York Times analysis indicates that, since US President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, “the White House and other Republicans have called for actions that appear to mirror more than half of Project Esther’s proposals”. These range from threats to withhold gargantuan sums of federal funding for US universities that refuse to silence resistance to systematic slaughter to efforts to deport legal US residents for the crime of expressing solidarity with Palestinians. In addition to allegedly infiltrating US academia and disseminating “anti-Zionist narratives across universities, high schools, and elementary schools, often under the umbrella or within the rubric of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and similar Marxist ideology”, Project Esther’s authors contend that “the HSN and HSOs have mastered the use of America’s liberal media environment [and] are quick to gain attention for any and every demonstration, no matter how large or small, from every network across the country”. And that’s not all: “The HSN and HSOs have made prolific and unchecked use of social media platforms, such as TikTok, across the entire digital ecosystem to spout antisemitic propaganda.” To all of these ends, the policy paper offers a whole host of recommendations for how to stamp out the domestic pro-Palestine movement as well as humane and ethical attitudes in general: from purging “HSO-supporting faculty and staff” from educational institutions to making “potential demonstrators fear affiliation with HSOs” to banning “antisemitic content” from social media – which in Heritage Foundation jargon of course means anti-genocidal content. And yet in spite of all of Project Esther’s ruckus over the ostensibly existential anti-Semitic threat posed by the HSN, it turns out that “no major Jewish organizations appear to have participated in drafting the plan, or publicly endorsed it since its release”, according to a December article in the Forward. A news outlet catering to American Jews, the Forward reported that the Heritage Foundation had “struggled to attract Jewish supporters for its antisemitism plan, which appears to have been assembled by several evangelical Christian groups”, and that Project Esther “focuses exclusively on left-wing critics of Israel, ignoring the antisemitism problems from white supremacists and other far-right groups”. Meanwhile, in an open letter published this month, influential American Jewish leaders warned that a “range of actors” in the US are currently “using a purported concern about Jewish safety as a cudgel to weaken higher education, due process, checks and balances, freedom of speech and the press”. Now, if the Trump administration seems to be taking Project Esther and running with it, it is more out of concern for propagating a white Christian nationalist agenda that utilises Zionism and anti-Semitism charges to its own extremist ends. And this, unfortunately, is just the beginning of a far more elaborate project.

"opinions","Trump’s tariffs are failing, but the old model won’t save us either","18 May 2025",NA,"Trade wars won’t save workers. A new economic order can. On May 12, the United States and China announced that they are putting reciprocal tariffs on pause for 90 days. Some tariffs will be retained while trade negotiations continue, a joint statement said. This is yet another reversal of the sweeping tariffs US President Donald Trump imposed in early April that destabilised the global economy and sent stock markets into freefall.     Although he claimed that his measures would make the US economy “boom”, it was clear from the start that they would not work. A trade war cannot improve the lot of American workers, nor bring back manufacturing into the country. Now spooked by corporations slashing profit targets and reports of the US gross domestic product (GDP) shrinking, the Trump administration appears to be walking back on its strategy. But going back to economic liberalism under the guise of “stability” is not the right course of action. The current global economic system, distorted by policies favouring the rich sustained over decades, has proven itself to be unsustainable. That is why we need a new world economic order that promotes inclusive and sustainable development across both the Global North and South and addresses global socioeconomic challenges. The troubles that economies around the world currently face are the result of policies the elites of the Global North imposed over the past 80 years. In its original Keynesian vision, the economic order put forward by the Allied Powers after World War II aimed to combine trade, labour, and development best practices to foster inclusive growth. However, over the following few decades, corporate opposition in the US and Britain derailed this order, replacing it with a skewed system centred around the Global North’s chief economic instruments, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, both created in 1944. In the 1970s, economic elites blamed rising inflation and stagnation not on temporary shocks like the oil crisis but on what they saw as excessive concessions to organised labour: government overspending, strong unions, and heavy regulation. Subsequently, they launched an institutional counter-revolution against the Keynesian model of power sharing and social compromise. This counter-revolution took shape in the 1980s under US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who aggressively pursued policies to restore corporate profitability. They slashed taxes on the wealthy, liberalised international capital flows that made it easier to relocate production to low-cost economies, deregulated the financial sector, weakened labour unions, and privatised public services. As a result, outsourcing of labour, tax evasion, real estate speculation, financialisation, and credit-fuelled bubbles became US corporations’ dominant ways of making profit. In developing countries, the IMF, the World Bank and regional development banks pushed governments to cut public spending, privatise state-owned enterprises, remove trade barriers, and deregulate markets rapidly and with little regard for social consequences. As a result, the 1980s and 90s became lost decades for many countries embracing globalisation through radical liberalisation. These policies triggered massive employment shocks, rising inequalities, skyrocketing debt and persistent financial turbulence from Mexico to Russia. East Asian economies were the exceptions, as they learned to circumvent the straitjacket of liberal globalisation and joined the global economy on their own terms. The biggest beneficiaries of this system were Western economic elites, as corporations profited from low-cost production abroad and domestic deregulation at home. The same cannot be said for Western workers, who faced stagnating real wages, eroded labour protections, and increasing economic insecurity under the pressure of competitiveness, relocation, and automation. For those of us who studied the post-war economic order, it was apparent that without correcting the pitfalls of liberal globalism, a nationalist, illiberal counter-revolution was coming. We saw its signs early on in Europe, where illiberal populists rose to prominence, gaining a foothold first in the periphery and then gradually scaling up to become Europe’s most disruptive force. In the countries where they gained power, they pursued policies superficially resembling developmentalism. Yet, instead of achieving genuine structural transformation, they fostered oligarchies dominated by politically connected elites. Instead of development, they delivered rent-seeking and resource extraction without boosting productivity or innovation. Trump’s economic policies follow a similar path of economic populism and nationalistic rhetoric. Just like illiberal economic policies failed in Europe, his tariffs were never going to magically reindustrialise the US or end working-class suffering. If anything, tariffs – or now the threat of imposing them – will accelerate China’s competitive edge by pushing it to deepen domestic supply chains, foster regional cooperation, and reduce reliance on Western markets. In the US, the illiberal response will drag labour standards down, eroding real wages through inflation and propping up elites with artificial protections. Furthermore, Trump has no real industrial policy, which renders his reactive trade measures completely ineffective. A genuine industrial policy would coordinate public investment, support targeted sectors, enforce labour standards, and channel technological change towards good jobs. His predecessor, President Joe Biden, laid the foundations of such an industrial policy agenda in the Inflation Reduction and CHIPS acts. However, these programmes are now under attack from the Trump administration, and their remaining vestiges will not have a meaningful effect. Without these pillars, workers are left exposed to economic shocks and excluded from the gains of growth, while the rhetoric of reindustrialisation becomes little more than a political performance. While Trump’s economic policies are unlikely to work, returning to economic liberalism will not resolve socioeconomic grievances either. Let us remember that past efforts to maintain this deeply flawed system at any cost backfired. Following the 2008 global financial crisis, Western governments rescued big banks and allowed financial markets to return to business as usual. Meaningful reforms of the global economic architecture never materialised. Meanwhile, the living standards of working- and middle-class families from Germany to the US stagnated or declined as wages flatlined, housing prices soared, and economic insecurity deepened. We cannot return to this dysfunction again. We need a new global economic order focused on multilateral governance, ecological sustainability, and human-centric development. Such progressive global multilateralism would mean governments coordinating not only on taxing multinational corporations and curbing tax havens but also on regulating capital flows, setting minimum labour and environmental standards, sharing green technologies, and jointly financing global public goods. In this new economic order, the institutions of global economic governance would make space for developing and emerging countries to implement industrial policies and build stronger ties with public finance bodies to mobilise patient, sustainable capital. This cooperative approach would offer a practical alternative to liberal globalism by promoting accountable public investment and development-focused financial collaboration. Parallel to the eco-social developmentalism in emerging economies, wealthy nations need to embrace a post-growth model gradually. This strategy prioritises wellbeing, ecological stability, and social equity over endless GDP expansion. This means investing in care work, green infrastructure, and public services rather than chasing short-term profits or extractive growth. For mature economies, the goal should be shifting from growing more to distributing better and living within planetary limits. This would also allow more space for low- and middle-income countries to improve their living standards without overexploiting our limited shared natural resources. With stronger cooperation between national and multilateral public finance institutions and better tools to tax and regulate corporations, governments could regain the capacity to create stable, well-paying jobs, strengthen organised labour, and tackle inequalities. This is the only way for American workers to regain the quality of life they aspire to. Such progressive multilateralism would be a powerful long-term antidote against illiberal populism. Achieving this shift, however, requires building robust global and regional political coalitions to challenge entrenched corporate interests and counterbalance the existing liberal, capital-driven global framework. The challenge is clear: not only to critique Trump’s destructive policies but to present a bold, coherent vision of industrial renewal, ecological sustainability, and global justice. The coming months will show whether anyone is prepared to lead that transformation.

"opinions","Israel’s Gaza ‘disengagement’ that paved the way for conquest","17 May 2025",NA,"The Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 was not a concession. It was a strategic move to thwart Palestinian statehood. In August 2005, the Israeli government officially withdrew from the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian coastal enclave it had occupied continuously since 1967. Apart from pulling back its armed forces, it had to undertake the dismantlement of 21 illegal settlements housing 8,000 Jewish settlers. Israeli troops were deployed to begin the process, which pulled at the heartstrings of international media outlets like The New York Times. The paper reported on the sobbing settlers affected by Israel’s “historic pullout from the Gaza Strip”, some of whom had to be carried “screaming from their homes in scenes that moved a number of the soldiers to tears”.     To be sure, there is nothing quite so tragic as illegal colonisers being uprooted from one section of land that does not belong to them and transferred to another section of land that does not belong to them. It bears mentioning that a majority of the Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip are themselves refugees from Israel’s blood-drenched conquest of Palestine in 1948, which killed 15,000 Palestinians, expelled three-quarters of a million more, and destroyed over 500 Palestinian villages. Since 2005, the myth of a unilateral Israeli “withdrawal” from Gaza has stubbornly persisted – and has been repeatedly invoked as alleged evidence of Israel’s noble willingness to occasionally play by the rules. And yet objectively speaking, what happened in August of that year was not much of a “withdrawal” at all, given that the Israeli military continued to control Gaza’s borders while subjecting the territory to a punishing blockade and periodic wanton bombardment. Israeli officials themselves made no effort to hide what they were really up to. In 2004, while the plan was still being discussed in the Knesset, Dov Weisglass, a senior adviser to then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, stated point-blank: “The disengagement is actually formaldehyde. It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so there will not be a political process with the Palestinians.” By “freezing” the political process, Weisglass went on to explain, “you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem”. Thanks to “disengagement”, then, the whole issue of Palestinian statehood had been “removed indefinitely from our agenda” – and all with the “blessing” of the president of the United States of America “and the ratification of both houses of Congress”. Since the so-called “withdrawal” from Gaza did not entail ceasing to make life hell for the Palestinian inhabitants of the territory, Israel remained ever-engaged on that front. On September 28, 2005 – the month following the drama of the sobbing settlers and soldiers – the late Dr Eyad El-Sarraj, founder of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme, wrote on the Electronic Intifada website: “During the last few days, Gaza was awakened from its dreams of liberation with horrible explosions which have shattered our skies, shaken our buildings, broken our windows, and threw the place into panic.” These were the effects of Israeli aircraft executing sonic booms in the skies over Gaza, a method El-Sarraj noted “was never used before the disengagement, so as not to alarm or hurt the Israeli settlers and their children”. And that was just the start of the “disengaging”. In 2006, Israel launched Operation Summer Rains in the Gaza Strip, which scholars Noam Chomsky and Ilan Pappe would subsequently characterise as being thus far the “most brutal attack on Gaza since 1967”. This, of course, was before Gaza was awakened from its dreams of liberation with an all-out Israeli genocide, which has now killed more than 53,000 Palestinians since October 2023. But there was plenty of brutality in between, from Israel’s Operation Cast Lead – which kicked off in December 2008 and killed 1,400 Palestinians in a matter of 22 days – to Operation Protective Edge, which slaughtered 2,251 people over 50 days in 2014. Along with periodic bouts of mass killing, the fluctuating Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip posed additional existential challenges. In 2010, for example, the BBC listed some of the household items that had at different times been blocked from entering Gaza, including “light bulbs, candles, matches, books, musical instruments, crayons, clothing, shoes, mattresses, sheets, blankets, pasta, tea, coffee, chocolate, nuts, shampoo and conditioner”. In 2006, Israeli government adviser Weisglass – the same character who revealed the “formaldehyde” approach to disengagement – also took it upon himself to charmingly clarify the logic behind Israel’s restrictions on food imports into the Gaza Strip: “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.” Now that Israel is literally starving Palestinians to death in Gaza with the full complicity of the United States, it seems the “idea” has undergone some revisions. Meanwhile, recent news reports citing unnamed Israeli officials indicate that Israel is also currently plotting the “conquest” and full military occupation of the Gaza Strip. Two decades on from Israel’s withdrawal-that-wasn’t from Gaza, it’s safe to surmise that “disengagement” paved the way for conquest. And this time around, there’s no disengagement plan.

"opinions","In Istanbul, Russia plays chess while the West is stuck in make-believe","16 May 2025",NA,"The war can only end on Moscow’s terms. The West’s inability to accept this harsh reality keeps Ukraine bleeding. As Russian and Ukrainian delegations descended on Istanbul on Friday in an attempt to end the three-year war in Ukraine, the contrast between the two parties in the conflict couldn’t be starker. One seemed assured, methodical – clear about its goals. The other, scattered and uncertain. Russia’s position on the contours of a potential settlement has long been clear – aside from its calculated ambiguity on territorial matters, which it maintains as leverage. Moscow continues to push for a return to the Istanbul agreements, derailed – as we now know – by the UK and US in the spring of 2022. At the same time, it demands to retain the territories it has occupied since then – and possibly more, though how much more remains deliberately undefined.     The position of the pro-Ukrainian coalition, by contrast, is chaotic. The United States has adopted an almost neutral stance, while Ukraine and its European allies are working to prevent Washington from pressuring Kyiv into what they view as a premature and unjust peace. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday that the Trump administration is open to any mechanism that could bring an end to the conflict. Meanwhile, Ukraine and its European partners are insisting on a 30-day ceasefire as a precondition for entering peace talks. Just before the Istanbul negotiations began, Ukraine declared that its delegation would not discuss anything with the Russians until a ceasefire was agreed upon. European countries supported that demand, with threats of severe sanctions they claimed they were prepared to impose. Whether Ukraine would ultimately drop this demand remained the key point of uncertainty as direct talks commenced in Istanbul on Friday afternoon. When the negotiators emerged from the venue and faced the press, they left that question unanswered. The two parties agreed to continue the talks, but ceasefire remains on the table – perhaps as a face-saving measure that would keep Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on board. The Russians are extremely unlikely to agree to any ceasefire until they see a clear path to the final deal. But the goal of this ceasefire game was all too transparent – especially to its intended audience: Donald Trump’s administration. A ceasefire clearly works against Russia, whose main leverage in the negotiations is the slow but steady advance of its troops along the 1,000+ km front line. The Ukrainian and European demand was designed to be rejected. Its real purpose is to derail the talks, pit Trump against Putin, and revive the longstanding strategy of trying to defeat Russia through a combination of enhanced military support for Ukraine and new economic sanctions on Moscow. This strategy isn’t new – and it has already cost Ukraine dearly over the past three years: Vast territory and critical infrastructure have been lost, hundreds of thousands killed, and 6.9 million people, mostly women and children, have left the country – likely for good. In response to what it sees as manipulation, Russia sent a delegation of lower-than-expected political stature, but including top-level military and diplomatic experts capable of discussing all technical aspects of a possible deal. The message: Moscow is ready for substantive negotiations – if they move beyond performative ultimatums. Russia’s position on the contours of a settlement hasn’t shifted since the previous Istanbul talks in spring 2022, when it insisted on a neutral Ukraine with a cap on the size of its military. The only difference now is territory. Under the 2022 Istanbul framework, Russia would have withdrawn to the lines of contact as they existed before the full-scale invasion. Now, it claims the territory seized since then – and maintains strategic ambiguity over the parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia still under Ukrainian control, using them as bargaining chips. Since the full invasion began, Moscow has viewed territorial occupation as a form of punishment for what it sees as Ukraine’s intransigence. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova put it bluntly on Thursday: “Ukrainian territory shrinks every time Ukraine rejects negotiations.” But territory is not the Kremlin’s main objective in Ukraine. Its central goal is to draw a hard red line against further Western military expansion near its borders – hence its demands to restore Ukraine’s neutral status and reduce the size of its armed forces to a bare minimum. Moscow, however, is open to the idea of Ukraine joining the EU – not least because that prospect remains highly unlikely, as countries like Poland and others in Eastern Europe see Ukraine’s agricultural sector as a threat to their economic stability. Given the current battlefield situation, the war can only end on Russian terms – harsh and unjust as they may appear. The daily gains of Russian troops and Ukraine’s slow territorial losses underscore this point. Every delay in peace talks results in a smaller Ukraine. Putin is acting like a political racketeer – much like those who ran St Petersburg during his formative political years: The longer you resist, the more you pay. But a deal on these terms would be extremely difficult to sell – to Ukrainians and to Europeans, who have also endured significant economic fallout from sanctions on Russia. The inevitable question arises: What, then, did Ukrainians fight and die for over the past three years? They could have secured a far better deal under the Minsk agreements in 2015 – or even the failed Istanbul deal in 2022. What kept Ukraine in the fight was the illusion – cultivated by the military-industrial complex and psychological operations on social media – that a nuclear power like Russia could be decisively defeated. The fear of being exposed as a major contributor to Ukraine’s suffering – alongside Russia – is what now drives European politicians to keep digging a deeper hole for Ukraine and its leadership, rather than admit (or quietly reframe) defeat in a war that, as President Trump rightly states, should never have happened in the first place. But nearly all the cards are now on the table. Illusions are being discarded one by one. The idea, floated by France and the UK, of deploying NATO troops in Ukraine has been all but shelved – it would escalate the conflict from a proxy war to a direct NATO-Russia clash. Meanwhile, the EU is preparing to reduce duty-free trade quotas on Ukrainian imports, which had helped sustain Ukraine’s economy for the past three years. This is a telling sign that Brussels no longer sees continued war as a realistic path forward. One of the last-ditch efforts to shift the course of events is under way in the Baltic Sea, where Nordic and Baltic states are attempting to open a second front in the Ukraine war by targeting the so-called Russian “shadow fleet”—oil tankers that help Moscow circumvent Western sanctions. But the most recent attempt to board one such vessel ended with a Russian fighter jet violating Estonian airspace – a clear warning of what could come next. The West is not prepared for a confrontation with Russia – let alone the nuclear conflict that would almost certainly follow. But there is no shortage of alternative, win-win strategies. Ukraine stands to gain the most from peace – once it is firmly established. The real losers would be the political class and security elites who invested so heavily in illusory outcomes.

"opinions","Seventy-seven years after the Nakba, we are naming our new ruin","16 May 2025",NA,"What began in 1948 has become something even darker. On this anniversary, we call it al-Ibādah – the Destruction. When my grandmother, Khadija Ammar, walked out of her home in Beit Daras for the last time in May 1948, she embarked on a lonely journey. Even though she was accompanied by hundreds of thousands of Palestinians – also forced to leave behind their cherished homes and lands to escape the horror unleashed by Zionist militias – there was no one in the world watching. They were together, but utterly alone. And there was no word to describe their harrowing experience. In time, Palestinians came to refer to the events of May 1948 as the Nakba, or the catastrophe. The use of the word nakba in this context invokes the memory of another “catastrophe”,  the Holocaust. The Palestinians were telling the world: just three years after the catastrophe that befell on the Jewish people in Europe, a new catastrophe –  very different, but no less painful – is unfolding in our homeland, Palestine.     Tragically, our catastrophe never came to an end. Seventy-seven years after my grandmother’s expulsion, we are still being hunted, punished and killed, for trying to live on our lands with dignity or demanding that we are allowed to return to them. Because it has never truly ended, commemorating the Nakba as a historical event has always been difficult. But today, a new challenge confronts us as we try to understand, discuss or commemorate the Nakba: it has entered a new and terrifying phase. It is no longer just a continuation of the horror that began 77 years ago. Today, the Nakba has transformed into what Amnesty International described as a “live-streamed genocide”, its violence no longer hidden in archives or buried in survivors’ memories. The pain, the blood, the fear and the hunger are all visible on the screens of our devices. As such, the word “Nakba” is not appropriate or sufficient to describe what is being done to my people and my homeland today. There is a need for new language – new terminology that accurately describes the reality of this new phase of the Palestinian catastrophe. We need a new word that could hopefully help focus the averted eyes of the world on Palestine. Many terms have been proposed for this purpose – and I have used several in my writing. These include democide, medicide, ecocide, culturicide, spacio-cide, Gazacide, and scholasticide. Each of these terms undoubtedly defines an important aspect of what is happening today in Palestine. One term that I find especially powerful as an academic is scholasticide. It underlines the ongoing, systematic erasure of Palestinian knowledge. Every university in Gaza has been destroyed. Ninety percent of schools have been reduced to rubble. Cultural centres and museums flattened. Professors and students killed. The term scholasticide, coined by the brilliant academic Karma Nabulsi, describes not only the physical destruction of Palestinian educational institutions but also the war being waged on memory, imagination and the Indigenous intellect itself. Another term I find evocative and meaningful is Gazacide. Popularised by Ramzy Baroud, it refers to a century-long campaign of erasure, displacement and genocide targeting this specific corner of historic Palestine. The strength of this term lies in its ability to locate the crime both historically and geographically, directly naming Gaza as the central site of genocidal violence. Although each of these terms is powerful and meaningful, they are all too specific and thus unable to fully capture the totality of the Palestinian experience in recent years. Gazacide, for example, does not encompass the lived realities of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, or those in refugee camps across the region. Scolasticide, meanwhile, does not address the apparent Israeli determination to make Palestinian lands inhabitable to their Indigenous population. And none of the aforementioned words address Israel’s declared intentions for Gaza: complete destruction. On May 6, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich chillingly stated, “Gaza will be entirely destroyed … and from there [the civilians] will start to leave in great numbers to third countries.” As such, I propose a new term – al-Ibādah or the Destruction – to define this latest phase of the Nakba. The term reflects the horrifying rhetoric employed by Smotrich and numerous other Zionist fascist leaders and captures the comprehensive and systematic erasure under way not only in Gaza, but across historic Palestine. Al-Ibādah is capacious enough to encompass multiple forms of targeted annihilation, including democide, medicide, ecocide, scholasticide, culturicide and others. In Arabic, the phrase for genocide, “al-Ibādah jamāʿiyyah” meaning “the annihilation of everyone and everything” has the word al-Ibādah as its root. The proposed term al-Ibādah intentionally truncates this phrase, transforming it into a concept that signifies a permanent and definitive condition of destruction. While it does not assign a specific geographical location, it draws conceptual strength from the work of Pankaj Mishra (The World After Gaza), who argues that the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza represents a qualitatively distinct form of genocidal violence. According to Mishra, Gaza constitutes the front line of Western neocolonial and neoliberal projects, which seek to consolidate global order around the ideology of white supremacy. By pairing the definite article with the noun, al-Ibādah asserts this condition as a historical rupture – a moment that demands recognition as a turning point in both Palestinian experience and global conscience. Today, when it comes to Palestine, the word “destruction” is no longer whispered. From military commanders to politicians, journalists to academics, vast segments of the Israeli public now openly embrace the complete destruction of the Palestinian people as their ultimate goal. Entire families are being wiped out. Journalists, doctors, intellectuals and civil society leaders are deliberately targeted. Forced starvation is used as a weapon. Parents carry the bodies of their children to the camera, to document the massacre. Journalists are killed mid-broadcast. We are becoming the martyrs, the wounded, the witness, the chroniclers of our own destruction. My grandmother survived the Nakba of 1948. Today, her children and over two million Palestinians in Gaza live through even darker days: the days of destruction. My pregnant cousin Heba and her family, along with nine of their neighbours, were killed on October 13, 2023. By then, just days after October 7, dozens of families had already been erased in their entirety: the Shehab, Baroud, Abu al-Rish, Al Agha, Al Najjar, Halawa, Abu Mudain,  Al-Azaizeh, Abu Al-Haiyeh. On October 26, 2023, 46 members of my own extended family were killed in one strike. By last summer, that number had grown to 400. Then I stopped counting. My cousin Mohammed tells me they avoid sleep, terrified they won’t be awake in time to pull the children from the rubble. “We stay awake not because we want to but because we have to be ready to dig.”  Last month, Mohammed was injured in an air strike that killed our cousin Ziyad, an UNRWA social worker, and Ziyad’s sister-in-law. Fifteen children under 15 were injured in the same attack. That night, as he had done countless times over the past 18 months, Mohammed dug through the rubble to recover their bodies. He tells me the faces of the dead visit him every night – family, friends, neighbours. By day, he flips through an old photo album, but every picture now holds a void. Not a single image remains untouched by loss. At night, they return to him – sometimes in tender dreams, but more often in nightmares. This month, on May 7, Israeli strikes on a crowded restaurant and market on the same street in Gaza City killed dozens of people in a matter of minutes. Among them was journalist Yahya Subeih, whose first child, a baby girl, was born that very morning.  He went to the market to get supplies for his wife and never returned. His daughter will grow up marking her birthday on the same day her father was killed – a terrible memory etched into a life just beginning. Noor Abdo, another journalist, compiled a list of relatives killed in this war. He sent the list to a human rights organisation on May 6. On May 7, he was added to it himself. A worker at the restaurant that was hit spoke about a pizza order placed by two girls. He said he overheard their conversation. “This is expensive, very expensive,” one girl said to the other. “That’s okay” she replied. “Let’s fulfil our dream and eat pizza before we die. No one knows.” They laughed and ordered.  Soon after their order arrived, the restaurant was shelled and one of the girls was killed. The worker does not know the fate of the other. He, however, says he noticed a single slice from their pizza was eaten. We can only hope that the one who was killed got to taste it. This, all this, is al-Ibādah. This is the destruction. In the face of global inaction, we are all but powerless. Our protests, our tears, our cries have all fallen on deaf ears. But we are still left with our words.  And speech does have power.  In the Irish play Translations, which documents the linguistic destruction of the Irish language by the British army in the early 1800s, the playwright Brian Friel explains how by naming a thing we give it power, we “make it real”.  So in a final act of desperation, let the commemoration of this year’s Nakba be the time when we name this thing and make it real: al-Ibādah, the Destruction.

"opinions","From 1948 to now, a Nakba that never ended","15 May 2025",NA,"Seventy-seven years ago, my grandfather was forced from his home. Now I’m reliving that same trauma in the ruins of Gaza. On May 15, 1948, my grandfather Saeed was just six years old when Zionist militias attacked his village in Beersheba, forcing his family to flee. His mother carried him as they escaped the horror of explosions and shelling. The nearest refuge was Gaza City. They arrived expecting to stay in makeshift tents for  a few days, certain they would soon return to their homes and fertile lands. They did not know then that their temporary stay would stretch into decades – that the tents would become permanent concrete shelters. The house keys they clung to would rust, transforming into symbols of a right of return passed down through generations  – 77 years and counting.     For most of my life, the Nakba lived in the past, a tragedy I inherited through my grandfather’s stories. But since 2023, I have lived my own Nakba in Gaza – this time in real time, under the lens of smartphone cameras and television screens. The militias that once expelled my grandfather have become a state with one of the world’s most advanced armies, wielding deadly weapons against a besieged civilian population demanding only freedom and dignity. In October 2023, Israel launched a campaign of forced displacement that eerily echoed what my grandfather had endured. Residents of northern Gaza were ordered to evacuate to the south – only for those areas to be bombed as well. Entire families walked for hours, barefoot, carrying only what they could. Once again, people found themselves in tents – this time made not of plastic but of scraps, cloth and whatever could shield them from the harsh sun or bitter cold. We faced death without bullets. Newborns died of cold and dehydration. Diseases the world had nearly eradicated like polio and malaria returned due to unsanitary conditions. Israel tightened its blockade, preventing food, medicine and basic essentials from entering. According to the World Food Programme, 96 percent of Gaza’s population now suffers from food shortages, ranging from moderate to catastrophic. The World Health Organization has confirmed at least 32 deaths from malnutrition among children under five and warns that the toll will rise. We now live as our grandparents once did: no electricity, no running water, cooking over firewood or in clay ovens. Smoke fills the air and clogs the lungs of mothers while children sleep with empty stomachs. Donkey carts have replaced cars – destroyed or rendered useless by fuel shortages. The occupation has stripped us not only of our land but also of the very basics of life. My grandfather who witnessed the first Nakba did not survive a second one. After a year of suffering, hunger and the absence of medical care, he passed away in October. He had lost half his body weight in a matter of months. His once-strong frame – he had been a proud athlete – was reduced to skin and bone. In his final days, he lay bedridden, silently enduring strokes and pain with no medicine, no proper food and no relief. I still remember our final embrace on October 11. It was a silent farewell. A tear slipped down the wrinkled cheek of a man who had witnessed too many wars and buried too many dreams. That tear said what words never could: it was time to go. And I ask myself: Would he have survived had there been no war? Could his last months have been filled with care instead of hunger? As if all this were not enough, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has openly called for the displacement of two million Palestinians from Gaza. His rhetoric only confirms decades-old Israeli plans, now receiving full backing from the United States. One such plan is cloaked in the language of “voluntary migration”, but the reality is far from voluntary. Life in Gaza has been made unliveable. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as of July 1, 85 percent of Gaza’s health facilities had been destroyed or damaged, including 32 of 36 hospitals. The education sector is equally devastated: UNICEF reports that 80 percent of Gaza’s schools and universities are no longer functional and at least 94 academics have been killed. The assault extends even to UNRWA, the UN agency that has supported Palestinian refugees since the original Nakba. Israel’s parliament has banned its operations in Palestinian territory while also bombing food warehouses and pressuring donor countries to cut funding. Why? Because UNRWA’s existence reminds the world of the refugees’ legal right of return. Israel wants that memory – and all physical traces of it – erased. Entire refugee camps, symbols of that right, have been flattened by bombs. Camps like Jabalia and Shati in the north and Khan Younis and Rafah in the south have been turned into mass graves. Once home to generations of dreams and defiance, these camps now cradle only the bones of those who refused to leave. So I ask again: Will my grandfather’s dream of returning to his land ever be realised? Or will history continue to turn its cruel wheel, spinning new chapters of exile and suffering? And will I one day tell my own children about our Nakba and our dreams of return – just as my grandfather once told me his?

"opinions","‘Adolescence’ is right: We’re failing both young men and women","15 May 2025",NA,"Teaching boys how to deal with anger is critical to stopping the spiral that ends up in violence. In 2014, I was teaching English to undergraduate freshers at a university in Massachusetts. A student in class, behind on his work, grew angry with a new assignment we were working on. He picked up a chair and threw it past an aisle of students and across the room. He then sat down as if nothing had happened. The chair did not strike anyone, but several students had to duck their heads. As someone who struggles with (post-traumatic stress disorder) PTSD and dissociation as a result of childhood abuse and domestic violence, I found myself frozen in front of my classroom, momentarily flashing back to previous violent incidents with a former partner.     I recalled this scene with my former student when I recently rewatched the four-part series Adolescence on Netflix. The series explores the consequences that befall a 13-year-old boy, his family, and community after he kills a female student who has bullied him online. As the police question Jamie, the main character, he continually denies his involvement. Eventually, a video of the murder is shown with Jamie stabbing the teenage girl. To me, the fact that a boy could kill a girl and convince himself that he had done nothing wrong points to a major societal failure. Boys are taught that acting on anger is acceptable. We have normalised it. When I was 25, I had been dating a man for several months. A friend of his was visiting and asked me if I was ready to go on an outdoor adventure with the two of them. In the spirit of the day, I said, “I was born ready.” My boyfriend misinterpreted this as a sexual innuendo and immediately slapped me hard across the face. No one said a word, and the day proceeded as if nothing had happened. My boyfriend’s friend never reached out to me after the incident. He never did or said anything that suggested that he thought the violence was unwarranted. That taught me that the violence was normal, acceptable behaviour. My student’s behaviour frightened me to the point that afterwards, I did not feel confident that I could keep the other 20 class students safe in his presence. I approached my supervisors, who suggested I contact both campus security and our on-campus learning disabilities centre, which offered services for students with physical or cognitive issues. I had expected campus security to have a conversation with the student and to document the chair event, so a paper trail could exist should further acts or threats of violence continue. Instead, campus police said no one had been hurt, so there was no incident to report. The learning disabilities centre could tell me that the student was in their programme, but that they could not share any information with me about the student or how best to handle him. Addressing these issues in young boys is critical to preventing serious violence in their behaviour when they grow older. We are failing our children and stand at a crossroads with increased violence in boys and young men that will only escalate if viable solutions are not found. My abusive former partner did not have a healthy male role model as he grew up. According to my abuser and his mother, he was not taught to curb his temper or monitor his anger. I believe that awareness must begin with parents and at an early age. Frustration and anger must be recognised, named and confronted. If young people can be taught to identify the actions that trigger their defensive or even uncontrollable responses, escalation can be prevented. When parents can acknowledge the child’s behaviour and point it out, solutions and alternatives to acting out can be offered. “Time out” at home and school should not be used as a punishment but as an opportunity to step back, take a breath, and re-evaluate the situation. The process must be repeated and reinforced to become a new pattern of response. Encouraging boys to identify and express their feelings, whether they be anger, sadness, or frustration, can be a huge step forward in teaching them to become aware of those feelings, rather than just acting on them. Once children enter school, discussions regarding feelings and appropriate actions must become a regular part of class instruction. A new definition of “time out” can offer students a practice in self-care, a healthy alternative to acting out anger. A time out in a school therapist’s office or with a guidance counsellor, or other trained staff, can become a safe place to calm down and discuss alternative responses to acting on anger. In classroom instruction, role-play situations can help students learn and practise alternative responses to anger and aggression when they are confronted with upsetting stimuli. This type of practice and reinforcement can become a new automatic response if children are given sufficient feedback and opportunity in both home and school situations. Teaching issues of mental health in classrooms beginning at an early age can help destigmatise emotions of shame, isolation and powerlessness. Embarrassment and shame can be significant triggers for both boys and girls, and in Adolescence, did in fact lead Jamie to fatally stab the girl who bullied him online. Shame and anger are normal human responses to certain situations, but addressing these feelings from a very young age can assist children in learning healthy and safe ways of coping rather than lashing out against others. My abuser was also experiencing shame when he assumed my response to his friend was sexual. As a society, we teach boys and men that anger is acceptable. TV commercials and movies portray men as both physically and mentally strong to the point where any expression of vulnerability makes them weak and inferior. It is time we teach boys and men that they are stronger, not weaker, when they are aware of and comfortable with their emotions. Until men and boys can identify and switch emotional gears instead of acting on anger, we will never be able to create a society where all human beings — boys and men, girls and women — are able to interact with mutual respect and safety.

"opinions","This is Trump’s moment to deliver peace to the Middle East","14 May 2025","Jeffrey Sachs","By supporting Palestine’s UN admission, he can unlock regional stability, economic growth – and a lasting legacy. The Arab world stands at a crossroad – a moment of truth that hinges on the region’s unified leadership and moral clarity. As President Trump arrives in the Gulf this week, seeking investments and strategic partnerships, the opportunity for regional peace and security is overwhelmingly clear. The Arab leaders should explain clearly to President Trump that peace and economic development in the Middle East are within reach and depend on one critical condition: The admission of Palestine to the United Nations as its 194th member state. For this to become a reality, the United States must lift its veto on Palestine’s entry to the UN. As the President meets with regional partners, he should hear an unambiguous message from his counterparts: All Arab partnerships with the US and of course with Israel are contingent upon a lasting peace through the two-state solution, which the US can bring about.     What is at stake is not simply a diplomatic negotiation. The two-state solution is a practical imperative and a test of international resolve. There can be no peace in the region, and no long-term development, if Israel continues to maraud its way through Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and others. Israel must be compelled – through diplomacy – to live within its own borders, and to allow Palestine to live within its legal borders, those of June 4, 1967. If the US backs the admission of Palestine to the UN, this will happen. The stakes could not be higher. The US would receive a windfall of investments. The Middle East would achieve normalcy and the basis for a surge of economic development, and both Israel and Palestine would live in peace. The Trump administration, in a significant departure from previous administrations, is moving towards a foreign policy centred on pragmatic deal-making diplomacy. Under his guidance, diplomatic negotiation channels were opened with Iran – as both countries enter their fourth round of negotiations in Oman regarding nuclear talks. President Trump has repeatedly stated his willingness to reach consensus: “I think we’re going to make a deal with Iran”, and is even willing to meet Iran’s president. Similarly, the US reached a ceasefire agreement with the Houthis in Yemen last week, an encouraging step for both global trade and stability. Another bold diplomatic manoeuvre is the US direct negotiations with Hamas, which resulted in the release of hostage Edan Alexander. It has become increasingly clear that President Trump holds US strategic interests above all else, and that he correctly views peace as his country’s overarching strategic interest. This translates into true potential for peace in the Middle East. The foes of peace in Israel’s extremist government want us to believe that there is an intrinsic, almost innate reason for the war on Palestine to continue. In essentially racist terms, Netanyahu and his ilk are arguing that peace with Palestinians, based on Palestinian political self-determination and self-rule, is impossible. The result is Israel’s brutal destruction and de facto annexation of Gaza and Israel’s ongoing war on Palestinians in the West Bank. Netanyahu’s government has two main interests: Continuing the war in Gaza and the West Bank to block a Palestinian state, and drawing the United States into direct confrontation with Iran. Both are contrary to US interests. This Israeli government is now completely isolated in the international community. Even the United Kingdom, previously a staunch supporter of Netanyahu’s war, has shifted its position. Minister for the Middle East Hamish Falconer stated that the government’s position is “crystal clear”: “We strongly oppose the expansion of Israel’s operations. Any attempt to annex land in Gaza would be unacceptable.” The vast majority of UN member states have already demonstrated their support for the two-state solution, most recently by adopting the UN General Assembly resolution. The will of the global community is clear: Israel’s illegal occupation must end, and a Palestinian State must be established in accordance with international law. This is possible under the mantle of the United Nations, this upcoming June, during the High-level International Conference on Palestine. Peace has been the generational clear-cut position of the League of Arab States, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and all regional partners. The Arab Peace Initiative (API), adopted at the Beirut Summit in 2002 and reiterated consistently over the years, demands Israel’s withdrawal from the occupied territory and the establishment of a Palestinian state as the basis for peace and diplomatic normalisation with Israel. President Trump and the Arab leaders have a historic opportunity this week to end a conflict that has raged for one century. By adopting the two-state solution, Trump would not only bring peace to Israel and Palestine, but also to Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. An agreement between the US and Iran regarding nuclear non-proliferation and an end to US sanctions on Iran would immediately come within reach. Belligerents could lay down their arms, and rebuilding and economic development could come to the forefront. In short, this week offers the extraordinary opportunity for the US and the Arab world to make history, for the benefit of the entire Middle East, including Israel and Palestine, and indeed for the benefit of the entire world.

"opinions","Medical professionals must speak out and act on Gaza now","13 May 2025",NA,"I spent 22 days in Gaza. I saw so much death and destruction but also unbelievable courage, compassion and dedication. We must not abandon our colleagues there. I had closely followed the genocidal war in Gaza for nine months when an opportunity came around to volunteer as part of a medical mission organised by the United Nations, World Health Organization and the Palestinian American Medical Association. As a trained nephrologist, a doctor who treats patients with kidney disease, I felt there was a critical need for specialised medical care amid the collapse of the healthcare system in Gaza and the high number of medical specialists who had been killed.     I also felt it was my duty as a Muslim to help the people of Gaza. Islam teaches us that whoever saves one life, it is as if he had saved all of humanity; taking care of others is an act of worship, and standing up against injustice is a moral obligation. I believe my degrees are not meant to simply hang on the walls of an air-conditioned office or help me drive the nicest car or live in an expensive neighbourhood. They are a testament to the fact that I have taken an oath to dedicate my expertise to the service of humanity, to maintain the utmost respect for human life and to offer my medical knowledge and compassion to those in need. So on July 16, I departed for Gaza with a few other medics. We entered the strip through the Karem Abu Salem crossing. We went from observing the prosperity, comfort and wealth of the Israeli side to recoiling at the destruction, devastation and misery of the Palestinian side. We basically saw what apartheid looks like. On our short trip through southern Gaza to reach our destination in Khan Younis, we saw many buildings bombed, damaged or destroyed. Homes, schools, shops, hospitals, mosques – you name it. The amount of rubble was sickening. To this day, I can’t unsee the landscapes of destruction I witnessed in Gaza. We were accommodated in Al-Nasser Hospital because it was too dangerous to stay at any other place. We were welcomed and cared for so much that I felt embarrassed. We were seen as saviours. I treated patients with kidney problems, worked as a primary care physician and sometimes helped during mass casualty events in the emergency room. Dialysis requires clean water, sterile supplies, reliable electricity, medications and equipment that must be maintained and replaced – none of which was guaranteed under the Israeli blockade. Each dialysis session was a challenge. Every delay increased the risk of my patients dying. Many of them did die – a fact I struggled to accept, knowing that under normal circumstances, many of them could have been saved and lived normal lives. I remember the smiling face of one of my patients, Waleed, a young man who suffered from kidney failure caused by early-onset high blood pressure, a condition that, with access to proper treatment, could have been managed appropriately. Dialysis was Waleed’s lifeline, but he couldn’t get an adequate number of sessions due to the Israeli blockade causing severe shortages of medical supplies. Malnutrition and worsening living conditions only accelerated his decline. I remember how short of breath he was, his body overloaded with fluid and his blood pressure dangerously high. And yet, every time I saw him, Waleed greeted me with a warm smile, his spirit somehow intact, his mother always by his side. A few months after I left Gaza, Waleed passed away. Another patient of mine was Hussein, a gentle, kind-hearted, deeply respected man. His children cared for him with love and dignity. He suffered from severe hypokalaemia and acidosis: His body’s potassium levels were dangerously low, and acid built up to toxic levels. To address his condition, he needed basic medications: potassium supplements and sodium bicarbonate pills. These were simple, inexpensive, life-saving medicines, and yet, the Israeli blockade did not allow them in. Because he could not find these pills, Hussein was hospitalised multiple times for intravenous potassium supplementation. Despite his immense suffering, Hussein remained gracious, brave and full of faith. When speaking, he always repeated the phrase Alhamdulillah (praise be to God). He passed away a few weeks ago, I was told. Waleed and Hussein should be here – smiling, laughing, living happily with their families. Instead, they became casualties of siege and silence. These are two of so many tragic stories I know of and I witnessed. So many beautiful lives that could have been saved were lost. Despite this grim reality, my colleagues in Gaza continue to do their utmost for their patients. These are medics who are bruised in every way. They are not only battling the daily struggles of life like all other Palestinians in Gaza but also witnessing daily horrors of headless babies, amputated limbs, fully burned human beings and sometimes the lifeless remains of their own loved ones. Imagine working with no anaesthesia, limited pain medications, very few antibiotics. Imagine surgeons scrubbing with plain water, children undergoing amputations with no sedation, full-body burns patients’ dressings being changed with no pain relief. Still these healthcare heroes just keep going. One of the nurses I worked with, Arafat, made a deep impression on me. He was living in a makeshift shelter with multiple family members. It offered no protection against the elements – the cold winter, the scorching heat or the drenching rain. He starved – like all other Palestinians in Gaza – losing 15kg (33lb) in nine months. He walked 2km to 3km (1 to 2 miles) every day to work with worn-out sandals, facing the danger of Israeli drones bombing or shooting him in the street. And yet, the smile never left his face. He took care of more than 280 dialysis patients, treating them with care, attentively listening to their anxious families and uplifting his colleagues with light humour. I felt so small next to heroes like Arafat. His and his colleagues’ resilience and persistence were unbelievable. While in Gaza, I had the opportunity to visit Al-Shifa Hospital with a UN delegation. What once was Gaza’s largest and most vital medical centre was reduced to ruins. The hospital that was once a symbol of hope and healing had become a symbol of death and destruction, of the deliberate dismantling of healthcare. It was beyond heartbreaking to see its charred, bombed-out remains. I stayed in Gaza for 22 days. It was an absolute honour to visit, serve and learn life from the resilient people of Gaza. Their relentless courage and determination will stay with me until I die. Despite witnessing what I could have never imagined, I did not have the urge to leave. I wanted to stay. Back in the United States, I felt profound guilt that I left behind my colleagues and my patients, that I did not stay, that I did not do enough. Feeling this constant heartache, I cannot understand the growing number of people who are accustomed to the daily reports of Palestinian deaths and images of torn bodies and starving children. As human beings and as health workers, we cannot quit on Gaza. We cannot stay silent and passive. We must speak out and act on the devastation of healthcare and attacks on our colleagues in the Gaza Strip. Already fewer and fewer healthcare workers are being allowed to enter Gaza on medical missions. The current blockade has prevented all medical supplies from going in. We, as healthcare professionals, must mobilise to demand an immediate lifting of the siege and free access to medical missions. We must not stop volunteering to help the struggling medical teams in Gaza. Such acts of speaking out and volunteering give our colleagues in Gaza the hope and comfort that they have not been abandoned. Let us not allow Gaza to be just a symbol of destruction. Instead, let it be the example of unbreakable spirit. Stand, speak and act – so history remembers not just the tragedy but also the triumph of human compassion. Let us uphold human dignity. Let us tell Gaza, you are not alone! Humanity is on your side! The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.

"opinions","India’s ‘new normal’ of perpetual war will damage its democracy","13 May 2025",NA,"The BJP whipped up war fervour in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack. Now it cannot ‘disappoint’ with peace. On May 12, two days after the announcement of a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally addressed the nation. He stated that the Indian army had only “paused” military action and Operation Sindoor, launched in the aftermath of the April 22 massacre in Pahalgam to target “terrorist hideouts”, had not ended. “Now, Operation Sindoor is India’s policy against terrorism. Operation Sindoor has carved out a new benchmark in our fight against terrorism and has set up a new parameter and new normal,” he said.     Modi’s speech was clearly not meant to reassure the Indian people that the government can guarantee their safety or security and is seeking peace and stability. Instead, it was meant to warn that the country is now in a permanent warlike situation. This new state of affairs has been called not to secure the national interest but to satisfy Modi’s nationalist support base, which was bewildered and disappointed with the announcement of the ceasefire by United States President Donald Trump. The detrimental impact that this new militarised normal will have on Indian democracy is clearly a price worth paying, according to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The truth is, the political establishment unwittingly put itself in a difficult position when it decided to capitalise politically on the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack in India-administered Kashmir and whip up war fervour. While victims of the attack like Himanshi Narwal, who survived but lost her husband, navy officer Vinay Narwal, called for peace and warned against the targeting of Muslims and Kashmiris, the BJP called for revenge and embraced anti-Muslim rhetoric. As a ruling party, it did not feel the need to take responsibility for failing to prevent the attack or explain the carelessness in securing tourist destinations. It immediately converted this act of killing into an act of war against India. Actions followed the hate rhetoric swiftly. Muslims and Kashmiris were attacked in several parts of India, and arrests were made of those criticising the Indian government. In Kashmir, nine houses were blasted immediately as punishment of those who had any link with “terrorists”, and thousands were detained or arrested. People with Pakistani passports were deported, and families were broken. Then, Operation Sindoor was announced. The Indian army’s targeting of Pakistani sites was accompanied by frenzied calls from the mainstream media for the complete obliteration of Pakistan. Major TV platforms – entirely falsely – declared the Karachi port had been destroyed and the Indian army had breached the border. The war cries and fake news emerging from the TV studios and the frantic messaging from the IT cells of the BJP led its supporters to believe that a decisive battle against Pakistan had been launched and its fall was imminent. In parallel, critical voices were swiftly silenced. The Indian government requested the blocking of 8,000 accounts from the social media platform X, including those of BBC Urdu, Outlook India, Maktoob Media, veteran journalist Anuradha Bhasin and political content creator Arpit Sharma. Just when war fever had gripped the BJP’s support base, the sudden announcement of a ceasefire by the US caught them by surprise. The truce was seen as a retreat and an admission of weakness. Some of the BJP’s online supporters turned on the foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, who had declared the ceasefire as the representative of the government of India. He was viciously attacked, and his timeline was flooded with abusive and violent messages, calling him a traitor and coward. His daughter also faced abuse. The trolling was so severe that Misri had to lock his social media accounts. Interestingly, but unsurprisingly, we did not hear about the blocking of any social media accounts trolling him or any action by the police against them. There was no action to protect Narwal either after she faced abuse and humiliation by the same crowd for daring to call for peace. Meanwhile, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights, which focuses on rights violations in marginalised communities, has released a report saying 184 hate crimes against Muslims – including murder, assault, vandalism, hate speech, threats, intimidation and harassment – have been reported from different parts of India since April 22. On Saturday, Misri claimed that India was a democracy that allowed criticism of the government. But the experience of critics raising questions about the objective and efficacy of Operation Sindoor has been bitter. Criticism of government requires parliamentary deliberation. But the government has been ignoring calls by opposition parties to convene the parliament, which means stalling democratic dialogue. Now that the prime minister has announced the operation has not ended, total loyalty from the Indian people will be demanded. Opposition parties would feel compelled to suspend all questions to the government. Muslims would feel a burden to prove their allegiance to the nation. The government will happily blame a dire economic situation that is of its doing on the war. There will be freedom of speech, but only for those who speak in favour of the BJP. Democracy in India thus remains in suspended animation as the country now faces a permanent enemy and a permanent war.

"opinions","Is Trump abandoning Israel? Not really","12 May 2025",NA,"The US president may have excluded Israel from his pursuit of megadeals in the Gulf, but he remains a committed supporter. United States President Donald Trump descends on Tuesday on the Middle East for a regional tour that will begin in Saudi Arabia and include stops in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. It is a business trip in every sense of the term, involving potentially trillions of dollars in investment and trade deals. The UAE, for example, has already pledged $1.4 trillion in investments to the US over 10 years in sectors ranging from artificial intelligence and energy to mining and aluminium production. Saudi Arabia, for its part, has committed to investing $600bn in the US over the next four years. According to the Reuters news agency, Trump will also be offering the kingdom an arms package to the tune of $100bn.     Meanwhile, in keeping with the president’s solid history of nepotism and self-enrichment, it just so happens that the Trump Organization is currently presiding over real estate projects and other business ventures in all three Gulf countries he is slated to visit. And yet one country is conspicuously absent from the regional itinerary despite being the US’s longstanding BFF in the Middle East: Israel, the nation that has for the past 19 months been perpetrating genocide in the Gaza Strip with the help of gobs of US money and weaponry. The official Palestinian death toll stands at nearly 53,000 and counting. Although the genocide kicked off on the watch of his predecessor President Joe Biden, Trump was quick to embrace mass slaughter as well, announcing not long after reassuming office that he was “sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job” in Gaza. It appears, however, that Israel is taking a bit too long for the US president’s liking – particularly now that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has prescribed an intensified offensive against an enclave that has already been largely reduced to rubble. The issue, of course, is not that Trump cares if Palestinian children and adults continue to be massacred and starved to death while Israel takes its sweet time “finishing the job”. Rather, the ongoing genocide is simply hampering his vision of the “Riviera of the Middle East” that will supposedly spring forth from the ruins of Gaza, the creation of which he has outlined as follows: “The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it.” So while war may be good for business – just ask the arms industry – it seems that too much war can ultimately be a counterproductive investment, at least from a Trumpian real estate perspective. In the run-up to Trump’s Middle Eastern expedition, reports increasingly circulated of tensions between the US president and the Israeli prime minister – and not just on the Gaza front. On Sunday, NBC News noted that Netanyahu had been “blindsided – and infuriated – this past week by Trump’s announcement that the US was halting its military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen”. Even more annoying to the Israeli premier, apparently, is Trump’s refusal to endorse military strikes on Iran. Plus, the US has reportedly discarded the demand that Saudi Arabia normalise relations with Israel as a condition for US support for the kingdom’s civilian nuclear programme. What, then, does the strained Trump-Netanyahu rapport mean for the ever-so-sacred “special relationship” between the US and Israel? According to an article published by the Israeli outlet Ynetnews: “Despite the tensions, Israeli officials insist behind-the-scenes coordination with the Trump administration remains close, with no real policy rift.” The dispatch goes on to assure readers that US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has “denied rumors that Trump might announce support for a Palestinian state during the visit” to the three Gulf nations. Of course, it’s not quite clear what sort of “Palestinian state” could ever be promoted by the man proposing US ownership of the Gaza Strip and expulsion of the native Palestinian population. Although Israel may be sidelined on this trip, that doesn’t mean it won’t continue to serve a key function in general US malevolence. Just last month, Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir – source of the idea that there is “no reason for a gram of food or aid to enter Gaza” – was hosted by Republican officials at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. After a dinner held in his honour, Ben-Gvir boasted that Republicans had “expressed support for my very clear position on how to act in Gaza and that the food and aid depots should be bombed”. Flashy trillion-dollar Gulf deals aside, rest assured that the Trump administration remains as committed as ever to capitalising on Israeli atrocities.

"opinions","India tried to project strength but ended up showing weakness","11 May 2025",NA,"In the aftermath of Operation Sindoor, India’s image as a regional hegemon has frayed. On May 10, United States President Donald Trump announced a “full and immediate” ceasefire between India and Pakistan brokered by his administration. US media reported that, alarmed by intelligence signalling further escalation, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles drove urgent mediation. Vance warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of catastrophic risks and encouraged direct talks between India and Pakistan. The announcement of the ceasefire was received across the world with a sigh of relief. The spectre of a nuclear exchange, which according to one 2019 study could kill up to 125 million people in less than a week, had fuelled regional anxiety and spurred the US diplomatic frenzy.     In India, however, Trump’s announcement was seen differently in some quarters. Former Indian army chief Ved Prakash Malik posted on X: “Ceasefire 10 May 25: We have left India’s future history to ask what politico-strategic advantages, if any, were gained after its kinetic and non-kinetic actions.” MP Asaduddin Owaisi wrote on the same platform: “I wish our PM @narendramodi had announced the ceasefire rather than the President of a foreign country. We have always been opposed to third party intervention since Simla (1972). Why have we now accepted it? I hope the Kashmir issue will not be internationalised, as it is our internal matter.” The latter comment likely refers to Trump’s statement that he is willing to work with India and Pakistan “to see if, after a ‘thousand years,’ a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir”. The ceasefire announcement by the US president appears to have been perceived by some in India as a sign of the Modi government’s retreat under US pressure while his offer to mediate on Kashmir is being seen as an indication that India’s longstanding rejection of third-party intervention is being undermined. In South Asian geopolitics, perception often outpaces reality – until reality bites. India has long projected regional dominance, bolstered by economic growth and nuclear might. Yet its actions in the aftermath of the April 22 massacre carried out by the Resistance Front (TRF) in Kashmir exposed its vulnerabilities. Intended to assert strength, India’s response faltered, boosting Pakistan’s regional standing and leaving Modi’s government diplomatically weakened. On May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle terrorist bases linked to groups like the TRF, which, it claims, is supported by Pakistan. Backed by French-made Rafale jets, the operation sought to project Modi’s strongman image amid domestic outrage. Yet its success was contested. Pakistan reported civilian casualties, including children, while India insisted only terrorist sites were hit. Pakistan’s air force scrambled its own jets to deflect the attack and claimed it downed five Indian jets, including three Rafales. Two US officials confirmed to the Reuters news agency that a Chinese-made J-10 jet shot down at least two Indian planes, aided by Chinese intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) support. India has not acknowledged any losses. Indian media initially claimed devastating strikes on Pakistani cities, including Karachi’s seaport, but these reports, which were clearly part of propaganda efforts, were proven false. On May 9, India launched missile attacks on Pakistani bases, including one near Islamabad, Pakistan claimed. The Pakistani army retaliated with short-range missile and drone strikes targeting Indian airbases at Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj. Indian air force officer Vyomika Singh reported Pakistani drones and munitions hit civilian and military targets. India’s image as a regional hegemon frayed. The Indian government clearly overestimated its Rafale jets and underestimated Pakistan’s Chinese-backed ISR systems, which enhanced battlefield precision. China’s military support for Pakistan has increased significantly in recent years. Since 2020, it has accounted for 81 percent of Islamabad’s military imports. For years, some Indian defence analysts warned that India’s military was unprepared for a China-supported Pakistan, given its limited US or Russian backing for its high-risk Kashmir gamble. Others criticised the government’s foreign policy for encouraging China-Pakistan rapprochement. Their warnings remained unheeded in New Delhi. The events of the past few days exposed India’s strategic limits, replacing ambiguity with global scrutiny. The kneejerk reaction in New Delhi may be to increase the defence budget and deepen even further the militarisation of Kashmir. As the Indian government plans its next steps, it should do well to consider that the status quo of shadow war and the cycle of covert aggression fuelling unrest is untenable. Both nations’ intelligence agencies have long backed proxies, driving instability from Kashmir to Afghanistan. The path forward rests on New Delhi and Islamabad making wise choices. Restraint, not rhetoric, should shape policies moving forward. Failure to do so risks geopolitical turmoil, economic stagnation and hardship for millions. Home to a quarter of the world’s poorest people and more than 350 million illiterate adults, India and Pakistan cannot afford prolonged strife. Continued tensions could derail India’s growth and cripple Pakistan’s fragile economy, dwarfing any tactical gains.

"opinions","What the Christians of the Holy Land expect from Pope Leo XIV","11 May 2025",NA,"We hope to see in the new pope a father who will stand by our side and protect us from oppression. Many Christians of the Holy Land rejoiced at the election of Pope Leo XIV as the successor to Saint Peter. Many of us hope that the new pope will follow the legacy of his predecessor, Pope Francis, particularly with regard to issues of justice and peace. The Holy See has historically played an important role in supporting the Christian presence in the Holy Land, whether through church activities, engagement with influential parties in and around the region, or through material and moral support. This has been reflected in the establishment of institutions such as the Pontifical Mission in Jerusalem, Bethlehem University, the Benedictus Center in Nazareth, and most recently, the donation by Pope Francis of the Popemobile to serve as a mobile clinic for children in Gaza.     Some of the most impactful moments in our recent history have been papal visits to our land — starting with Pope Paul VI in 1964, followed by Pope John Paul II in 2000, Pope Benedict XVI in 2009, and concluding with Pope Francis in 2014. We, Christians in the Holy Land, hope that Pope Leo XIV will not only come to visit us but also help address some of the challenges we face today in the birthplace of Christianity. As a community of 230,000 people, we are working to strengthen the Christian presence as an active component of the local society, in collaboration with its other components. However, we do need help. One of the main issues affecting Christian lives in Israel and Palestine is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is a persistent source of regional instability that fuels violence in various forms, which kills many, including Christians. Rising religious and political extremism makes many of us feel like strangers in our own homeland. Economic deterioration and the declining number of people coming for pilgrimage in the Holy Land due to the conflict are leading to a loss of livelihood and worsening socioeconomic conditions. Widespread despair is driving many to emigrate or plan to leave in the near future, dwindling the numbers of our community. Many local Christians want the Holy See to engage with key global and regional players to achieve a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In his last sermon, Pope Francis spoke about the urgent need for peace in Gaza. In his first sermon, Pope Leo XIV called for an immediate ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the Strip. We welcome these statements and hope he will continue to do his utmost to promote peace in the Holy Land. In Palestine, the situation remains unclear due to the Israeli occupation of all territories meant to form a Palestinian state, the ongoing war in Gaza, and the limited authority of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank — not to mention Israel’s full annexation of East Jerusalem. This reality calls for thoughtful action by the Church, both at the level of the Holy See and locally, to provide people with hope in these dark times. In Israel, there is a pressing need for cooperation between the Holy See and the local church — bishops, priests, and believers — to resolve many issues that affect the Christian and non-Christian communities. It is crucial to work with all segments of the local society to pressure the state to treat all its citizens equally and preserve their dignity. Christians hope that the Holy See can collaborate with us in our efforts to achieve equality. We, as a community, face Israeli laws that discriminate against us based on ethnicity and religion; we need support in our efforts to have such laws repealed. It is also essential to work towards resolving painful issues that have negatively impacted the Christian presence, such as the case of the villages of Iqrit and Biram, whose Catholic Christian residents were expelled before their homes were destroyed by the Israeli authorities in 1951. Since then, the residents and their descendants have been demanding to return to their ancestral lands, but are being denied this right. There is also a need for stronger intervention by the Holy See to support Christian institutions operating under Israeli control, which face growing challenges, such as attempts by some municipalities to impose heavy taxes in violation of past agreements, the clear discriminatory underfunding of Christian schools by Israeli authorities, and threats against church property. Many Christians of the Holy Land also hope that Pope Leo XIV will work to enhance unity among them, including efforts to reach a unified date for major religious holidays, especially Christmas and Easter. They also call for increased joint efforts among churches to organise pilgrimages to the Holy Land that include not only visits to religious sites but also interactions with the faithful who live there. This is important because it would help us raise global awareness about the challenges we face and feel an integral part of the universal Church. As a whole, Christians in the Holy Land, like their fellow Christians around the world, desire to see a father in Pope Leo XIV — a father who visits them and welcomes their visits, consults with them and listens to their concerns, protects them from harm, stands with them when they are attacked or oppressed, and follows in the footsteps of the Church’s founder, who never hesitated to defend the oppressed regardless of how powerful the oppressor might be. Pope Leo XIV should know that he has many children in the Holy Land who love him and understand how busy he and the Holy See are with so many issues around the world. In the Holy Land, Christians have prayed — and continue to pray — for his success in his mission, fully aware of how complex it is. But above all, the children need their father — and that is what they expect the most: that he will always stand by their side, despite how busy he might be.
