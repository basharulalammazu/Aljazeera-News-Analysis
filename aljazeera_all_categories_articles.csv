"news","Largest US retailer Walmart warns of price hikes because of tariffs","15 May 2025",NA,"Walmart is a bellwether of US consumer health and its statement is a signpost of the impact of the trade war. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, will have to start raising prices later this month due to the high cost of tariffs, executives have warned in a clear signal that United States President Donald Trump’s trade war is filtering through to the US economy. As a bellwether of US consumer health, Walmart’s explicit statement on Thursday is also a signpost for how the trade war is affecting companies as Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low. Walmart’s shares fell 2.3 percent in morning trading after it also declined to provide a profit forecast for the second quarter, even as the company’s US comparable sales surpassed expectations in the first quarter. Net sales rose 2.5 percent to $165.6bn, a hair shy of estimates, while same-store sales were up 4.5 percent. Walmart’s quarterly adjusted profit was 61 cents per share, ahead of the analyst consensus for 58 cents per share. Many US companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of the trade war, as consumers stretch their budgets to buy everything from groceries to essentials at cheaper prices. But Walmart’s statement will resonate nationwide, as roughly 255 million people shop in its stores and online weekly around the world, and 90 percent of the US population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart. US shoppers will start to see prices rise at the end of May and certainly in June, Walmart’s Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in a CNBC interview. On a post-earnings call with analysts, he said the retailer would also have to cut back on orders as it considers price elasticity. As the largest importer of container goods in the US, Walmart is heavily exposed to tariffs, and even though the US and China reached a truce that lowered levies for imports on Chinese goods to 30 percent, that’s still a high cost to bear, executives said. “We’re very pleased and appreciative of the progress that has been made by the administration to bring tariffs down … but let me emphasise we still think that’s too high,” Rainey said on the call, referring to the tariff cuts negotiated over the weekend. “There are certain items, certain categories of merchandise that we’re dependent upon to import from other countries and the prices of those things are likely going to go up, and that’s not good for consumers,” he added.    Other retailers also said they would be boosting prices. German sandal maker Birkenstock on Thursday said it plans to raise prices globally to fully offset the impact of the US tariff of 10 percent on European Union-made goods. US consumer sentiment ebbed for a fourth straight month in April, signaling watchful purchasing, while the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted for the first time in three years during the first quarter, fanning worries of a recession. Walmart’s CEO Doug McMillon said the retailer would not be able to absorb all the tariffs’ costs because of narrow retail margins, but was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise – which primarily come from China – do not drive food prices higher. To mitigate the impact, Walmart is working with suppliers to substitute tariff-affected components, such as replacing aluminium with fibreglass, which is not subject to tariffs. Despite these efforts, McMillon noted that adjusting costs is more challenging in cases where Walmart imports food items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses from countries such as Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia. Analysts said Walmart was better positioned than rivals, as its scale enables it to lean on its suppliers and squeeze out efficiencies to shield customers from tariffs, but only so much. “There will likely be some demand destruction from tariffs; a complete wreck is unlikely,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Walmart on Thursday kept its annual sales and profit forecast intact for fiscal 2026, but withheld second-quarter operating income growth and earnings per share forecasts, citing a “fluid operating environment … [which] makes the very near term exceedingly difficult to forecast at the level and speed at which tariffs could go up”.

"news","UK’s Starmer seeking third countries to set up asylum seeker ‘return hubs’","15 May 2025",NA,"PM’s plans compared to Conservatives’ controversial Rwanda deportation policy, which he had dismissed as a ‘gimmick’. The United Kingdom is talking to third countries about setting up “return hubs” to host asylum seekers refused the right to stay in the country as part of a renewed crackdown on immigration, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. The UK leader is under increasing pressure to cut the number of migrants arriving on UK shores amid the rising popularity of the far-right Reform UK Party. He said on Thursday that he was talking to “a number of countries” about hosting the “return hubs”, which would receive failed asylum seekers who have exhausted all avenues of appeal for processing prior to deportation. Speaking during a visit to Albania, Starmer did not specify which countries he was speaking to about the scheme, which has drawn comparisons with a plan developed by the previous Conservative government to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, which Starmer had dismissed as a gimmick and scrapped immediately after entering office in July.    The subject was apparently not on the agenda for Starmer’s meetings in Tirana, with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama specifying in a joint news conference that a similar returns model, which his country had agreed to with Italy last year, was a “one off” that “takes its time to be tested”. That scheme, which could see Italian-run facilities in Albania holding up to 36,000 asylum seekers annually while their applications are fast-tracked, is currently bogged down in the courts. Starmer admitted that establishing the facilities would not be a “silver bullet” for halting the perilous crossings of the English Channel in small boats, which have seen 12,000 people arriving so far this year, putting 2025 on course to potentially see a record high number of arrivals. However, combined with other measures to tackle smuggling gangs, he said the plan would “allow us to bear down on this vile trade”. Starmer claimed his new Labour government had been left a “mess” by the previous Conservative leadership, which he said had failed to process asylum claims. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said, “This will basically apply to people who have exhausted all legal routes to remain in the UK but are attempting to stall, using various tactics – whether it’s losing their paperwork or using other tactics to frustrate their removal.” The announcement was the latest in a host of tough new immigration policies, including plans to double the length of time before migrants can qualify for settlement in the country, which are widely seen as an attempt to fend off rising support for far-right firebrand Nigel Farage’s Reform UK Party.

"news","Ukraine’s Zelenskyy to send delegation for Russia talks after Putin no-show","15 May 2025",NA,"Putin’s absence casts doubt on peace talks in Turkiye, raising concerns about potential intensified sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is sending a team headed by his defence minister to Istanbul for the first direct talks with a Russian delegation since the early weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelenskyy announced the move on Thursday after the Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had no intention to meet with him in Turkiye, sending instead a junior delegation – a move that Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said was “like a slap in the face”. The Ukrainian president said in a news conference in the Turkish capital, Ankara, that the Russian delegation doesn’t include “anyone who actually makes decisions”, accusing Moscow of not making efforts to end the war. The Ukrainian delegation will be headed by Defence Minister Rustem Umerov with the aim “to attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation, the first steps toward ending the war – namely, a ceasefire”, he said. It was not immediately clear when the delegations would meet.    Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting in front of the Ukrainian embassy in Ankara, said Zelenskyy chose a delegation “in equilibrium” with the Russian one. “He said they didn’t mind taking the first step towards an immediate ceasefire that is necessary for direct peace talks,” she said. Still, “there won’t be any negotiations, and Zelenskyy underlined that even his delegation has no mandate to decide anything. So tomorrow, it is probably going to be technical talks between the two delegations,” she added. US President Trump, who had pressed for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face in Istanbul, brushed off Putin’s absence from the talks. “Nothing’s going to happen until Russian President Vladimir Putin and I get together, OK?” Trump said on board Air Force One just before landing in Dubai on the third stop of his Middle East trip. “I didn’t think it was possible for Putin to go if I’m not there.” Putin’s absence punctured hopes of a breakthrough in ceasefire efforts that were given a push in recent months by the Trump administration and Western European leaders amid the intense manoeuvring. It also raised the prospect of intensified international sanctions on Russia that have been threatened by the West. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier welcomed Zelenskyy with an honour guard at the presidential palace in Ankara before the two held talks. “Now, after three years of immense suffering, there is finally a window of opportunity,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said at a NATO meeting taking place separately in Turkiye. “The talks … hopefully may open a new chapter.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/15/ukraines-zelenskyy-sends-delegation-for-russia-talks-after-putin-no-show"
"news","Wisconsin judge pleads not guilty to obstructing immigration arrest","15 May 2025",NA,"Federal authorities allege that Judge Hannah Dugan helped an undocumented man evade arrest by immigration agents. A Wisconsin judge has pleaded not guilty to charges accusing her of helping an undocumented immigrant in her courtroom avoid arrest by immigration enforcement agents. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was charged last month with concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. She could face up to six years in prison if convicted on both counts. Dugan’s lawyer, Steven Biskupic, entered a not guilty plea on her behalf during a brief arraignment in a federal court on Thursday, with a trial date set for July 22. Immigration authorities allege she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a man in the US without documentation, and his lawyer out of her courtroom and through a backdoor as immigration agents sought to arrest him. The case is the latest to underscore tensions between local officials and a Trump administration pursuing an aggressive crackdown on immigration that civil liberties groups say has tested the limits of executive power. Dugan left the courtroom on Thursday without comment. A crowd of protesters outside of the court chanted “due process rights” and “keep your hands off our judges” and held signs reading “only fascists arrest judges — drop the charges” and “Department of Justice overreach”. Immigration raids on sensitive places such as courts have long been a matter of dispute, with immigration rights advocates saying that such raids discourage people in the US without documentation from accessing legal assistance or cooperating in legal matters. An FBI affidavit says that when an aide informed Dugan that immigration agents appeared to be in the hallway outside her courtroom, she called the situation “absurd” and later confronted them about their warrant. The Trump administration has consistently stated that it will seek to penalise local officials who do not help facilitate its enforcement push, even saying that legal action could be taken against such officials. State and local officials in Democrat-led states have also said in a recent lawsuit that the administration threatened to withhold federal funds if they are not more cooperative with enforcement efforts, which they maintain is unconstitutional since Congress is tasked with the allocation of federal funds.

"news","Chopra: Nadeem javelin friendship ‘not the same’ after India-Pakistan clash","15 May 2025","Hafsa Adil","The recent military escalations have damaged a once exemplary athlete bond between Olympic javelin throwers Neeraj Chopra of India and Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem. Doha, Qatar – India’s Olympic gold medal-winning athlete Neeraj Chopra believes the recent escalations between his country and neighbouring Pakistan will affect the hugely popular friendship he shared with his cross-border counterpart Arshad Nadeem. Both men’s javelin athletes have earned widespread praise for overlooking the decades-old South Asian rivalry with their friendly interactions at international tournaments, but Chopra said on Thursday that his relationship with Nadeem is unlikely to remain the same. India and Pakistan were involved in a brief but intense military confrontation last week that threatened to erupt into the fifth full-scale war between the two countries. “It will not be like it was before [the recent escalations],” Chopra told Al Jazeera when asked about the repercussions of the tensions on his friendship with Nadeem. “I never had a very deep friendship with him, but we were always respectful towards each other,” he added while speaking before the Doha Diamond League, a World Athletics meet scheduled for Friday in Qatar. The frequent words of encouragement and appreciation exchanged between Chopra, who won Olympic gold at Tokyo 2021, and Nadeem, who bagged gold at Paris 2024, rendered both the darlings of social media and the face of a rare cross-border friendship. Happy Birthday to my friend and fellow athlete @Neeraj_chopra1 Wishing you a year filled with happiness, success, better health and joy. May you have a wonderful life ahead! — Arshad Nadeem (@ArshadOlympian1) December 24, 2024  However, following the April 22 attack that left 26 civilians dead in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, Chopra faced intense social media backlash for inviting Nadeem to the May 24 Neeraj Chopra Classic javelin event in India. The invitation was extended before the attack and was declined by Nadeem, citing his preparations for the May 27-31 Asian Athletics Championship in South Korea. Chopra’s eponymous event was eventually postponed in the wake of the cross-border conflict, but not before the 27-year-old Indian athlete released a statement on April 25, saying Nadeem’s participation at the meet was “completely out of the question” following the Pahalgam attack. pic.twitter.com/yMsX8ggnLA — Neeraj Chopra (@Neeraj_chopra1) April 25, 2025  On May 7, India launched multiple missile attacks on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and the Pakistani military claimed to have shot down multiple Indian air force planes. Three days later, Pakistan retaliated with a missile attack on Indian airbases. Both countries were on the precipice of war before a United States-brokered ceasefire was agreed. Amid the war-like scenario, both Chopra and Nadeem took to social media to pledge their support for their respective armed forces. It was in stark contrast to the warmth shared by the world’s top javelin throwers, who often posed together for photographs at athletics events and shared greetings on social media. Chopra and Nadeem were gold and silver medallists at the World Athletics Championships in 2023 and celebrated together as the Indian asked his Pakistani opponent to join him for a photo and stood close with their arms around each other. When Nadeem became the first Pakistani track and field athlete to win a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, Chopra’s mother won hearts across the border when she said Nadeem was also like a “son” to her. It is unclear when the athletes will compete against each other, as Nadeem is not participating at the Doha Diamond League and Chopra is set to skip the Asian Athletics Championships in South Korea. Despite the fallout of the recent political and military standoff, Chopra said he will continue to maintain a respectful demeanour towards Nadeem. “I have a lot of friends in the athletics circuit since javelin throwers are a very small community,” Chopra said. “I will always reciprocate the respect I receive from my fellow athletes.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/15/chopra-nadeem-javelin-friendship-not-the-same-after-india-pakistan-clash"
"news","Could EU tariffs against Russia bring a ceasefire for Ukraine?","15 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","As Vladimir Putin rejects Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s proposal for a face-to-face meeting, the EU is readying penalties. Brussels is drawing up plans to use trade tariffs and capital controls to maintain financial pressure on Russia, even if Hungary decides to use its veto to block an extension of the European Union’s sanctions regime, which lapses in July of this year. The European Commission has told ministers that a large part of the EU’s sanctions, which included freezing 200 billion euros ($224bn) of Russian assets, could be adapted to a new legal framework to bypass Budapest’s veto, according to the United Kingdom’s Financial Times newspaper. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, has repeatedly held up EU boycotts on Moscow as the central European country gets 85 percent of its natural gas from Russia. Orban’s nationalist government is also one of the most friendly to Moscow in all of Europe. In any event, the EU’s recent proposals have emerged as Moscow and Kyiv hold their first direct peace talks since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukrainian and Russian representatives are convening today in Istanbul, Turkiye. However, Vladimir Putin will not travel to Istanbul for face-to-face talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Last weekend, European leaders held talks in Ukraine to put pressure on Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire in the run-up to the Istanbul talks. Ukraine agreed to it. Russia did not.    The EU adopted its 17th sanctions package against Moscow, designed to stifle Russia’s economy and force President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, on Wednesday. This package has been signed off by Budapest and will be formally ratified by the European Commission next week. Brussels has progressively expanded sanctions against Moscow since 2022, introducing import bans on Russian oil, a price cap on Russian fuel and the freezing of Russian central bank assets held in European financial institutions. Vast swaths of Russia’s economy – from media organisations to aviation and telecommunications – are now under EU restrictions, in addition to trade bans and measures targeting oligarchs and politicians. Under the 17th package, some 200 “shadow fleet” tankers have been sanctioned. These are ships with opaque ownership and no Western ties in terms of finance or insurance, allowing them to bypass financial sanctions. The latest sanctions will also target Chinese and Turkish entities that the EU says are helping Russia to evade embargoes. New restrictions will be imposed on 30 companies involved in the trade of dual-use goods – products with potential military applications. “Russia has found ways to circumvent the blockage imposed by Europe and the United States, so closing the tap would grab Russia by the throat,” France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, told BFM TV.    Alongside military support for Kyiv, sanctions have been the EU’s main response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. But sanctions have so far failed to stop the war. What’s more, due to high oil prices and elevated military spending, Russia’s economy has outperformed expectations since the start of 2022. Barrot acknowledged on Wednesday that the impact of sanctions has been insufficient. “We will need to go further because the sanctions so far have not dissuaded Vladimir Putin from continuing his war of aggression … we must prepare to expand devastating sanctions that could suffocate, once and for all, Russia’s economy,” said Barrot. While the 17th round of sanctions was only agreed on Wednesday, EU ministers are already considering what more might be done to undermine Putin’s political clout if the war in Ukraine persists. Capital controls, which would be aimed at restricting money flowing in and out of Russia, and trade measures such as tariffs, are two options that have been mentioned by the European Commission in recent weeks. Capital controls can take a variety of forms, including restrictions on foreign investment, limiting currency exchange or imposing taxes on the movement of capital. The commission also aims to share proposals next month that would allow Brussels to implement a ban on new Russian gas spot market contracts – deals for immediate delivery and payment – with European companies in 2025, and a total phase-out by 2027. Despite oil export restrictions, Russia still earns billions of euros from natural gas sales into the EU through liquefied natural gas (LNG) and TurkStream (a pipeline connecting Russia to southeastern Europe via the Black Sea). Banning spot market contracts would lower Moscow’s revenue from these sources. Brussels may also propose tariffs on enriched uranium as part of its effort to cut EU reliance on Russian fuels. According to The Financial Times, the EU insists that these measures would not amount to sanctions and therefore would not need the unanimous backing of all 27 EU countries, which is normally required to extend sanctions. “I think the EU cooked up these potential punishments to try and get Russia to agree to the 30-day ceasefire … it was the stick they were brandishing,” said an analyst familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. It may. On May 1, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he had the commitment of 72 colleagues for a bill that would enact “bone-crushing” sanctions on Russia. Graham, a close ally of President Donald Trump, is spearheading a draft bill that seeks to impose a 500 percent tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil and fossil fuels. Trump himself, who seemingly welcomes the possibility of a rapprochement with Russia, said in March that he was “considering” imposing sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a peace agreement is reached with Ukraine. “Most Russian people want life to return to normal and business owners are getting tired of war-related costs,” the anonymous analyst told Al Jazeera. “There is a growing sense of unease.” She said she doubted whether the EU’s touted measures would bring Putin any closer to signing a peace agreement, however. “Only because sanctions haven’t been able to do that,” she said, “and there’s already a maze of them.” According to Castellum.AI, a global risk platform, Russia has been slapped with 21,692 sanctions since the start of the war – the majority of them against individuals. “On past performance, it’s hard to see how even more sanctions and additional punishments will stop the fighting,” the analyst said. She estimated a 60 percent chance that Russia and Ukraine would still be at war by the end of this year.

"news","What have US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies achieved?","15 May 2025","Megha Bahree","Trump’s policies have roiled global markets and left businesses stumped on how to plan for the foreseeable future. When examining the on-again, off-again tariff proclamations of United States President Donald Trump during his second term in office, it is unclear what has actually been achieved. What is clear is that Trump’s tariff announcements have roiled global markets, wiping out trillions in value, and leaving many businesses stumped on how to plan for the future amid the never-ending uncertainty.     Within days of being sworn into office for his second term, Trump imposed 25-percent tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10 percent on China, arguing they needed to do more to stem the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migrants into the US. He soon suspended those on Canada and Mexico for 30 days – but not on China – in return for concessions on border and law enforcement. Since then, he has raised 25-percent tariffs on steel, aluminium, and auto and auto parts, and brought back levies on Mexico and Canada and doubled fentanyl-related tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20 percent. He then went back and forth on tariffs on car imports from Canada and Mexico, finally settling on a 25-percent on global car imports. Then, in April, he announced his “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries around the world, with a 10-percent baseline tariff on all countries around the world. He paused the “reciprocal” tariffs for 90 days after a bloodbath on Wall Street, but maintained the 10-percent global tax and instituted a 145-percent tax on China – which then retaliated with a 125-percent tax on US goods entering the country. Soon after, Trump started rolling back some tariffs as the US struck trade deals. The first came last week, in the form of a limited trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which kept in place the 10-percent levy on many products, but did lower US tariffs on British auto imports to 10 percent from the current 27.5 percent, annoying domestic US car-makers. But the one that everyone was watching for came earlier this week on Monday: The US and China announced a pause and scale back of tariffs for 90 days, with the US lowering its tax to 30 percent and China to 10 percent, while the two rivals hammer out a trade agreement. But even before the May 12 announcement, the US had already carved out exceptions for smartphones, computers and other tech products, that it largely imports from China. Then, per the Monday agreement, it also slashed the tariff on low-value, “de minimis” imports from China, reducing duties to 54 percent from 120 percent for items valued at up to $800. Such goods were previously brought into the US without having to pay any import duties and with minimal inspections. Such imports were heavily criticised, not only accused of flooding the country with cheap products, but for being used by traffickers to bring in drugs, including fentanyl. Fentanyl-trafficking was the justification for the initial tariffs placed on China, Mexico and Canada, so it’s not clear if the US government is still concerned about that route being potentially abused by drug hauliers. While the various tariff rollbacks and pauses have been welcomed by businesses, the respite has not removed uncertainty entirely. Brief pauses in tariffs are not sufficient for many companies to make longer-term investment or supply chain decisions.    It’s small businesses, which employ 45.9 percent of the US workforce and account for 43.5 percent of the US gross domestic product (GDP), that feel the effects most keenly because of their limited buffer, as we reported last week. There are fears that the uncertainty is taking a toll on the US economy. A Bloomberg poll of economists put the chances of a recession next year at almost 50-50, the news agency reported on Monday. And while inflation has so far been kept in check – consumer prices rose 2.3 percent in April from a year ago, down from 2.4 percent in March – economists have said they expect inflation to rise by the middle of the year, and consumer confidence has hit a 13-year low even before sky-high prices return. On Thursday Walmart, the world’s largest retailer and the biggest container importer in the US a lot of which is from China, warned it would have to start raising prices by the end of this month due to the high cost of tariffs even after they had been slashed to 30 percent. Trump has acknowledged a potential rise in prices – US children will have “two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally”, he said recently. But it’s not clear where he is headed with his tariffs, even as some companies have announced billions worth of new investments, and some that were recycling of previous ones – like Apple’s February announcement that it would invest $500bn in the US over the next four years, but which analysts said included current commitments. But that’s more a matter of the ledger for the next few years rather than jobs on the ground.

"news","India and Pakistan trade accusations of nuclear weapons mismanagement","15 May 2025",NA,"Islamabad hits back after Indian defence minister says Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal should be under UN surveillance. India and Pakistan have traded accusations of nuclear weapons mismanagement, days after reaching a truce following four days of cross-border fighting. India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh questioned the safety of nuclear weapons in Pakistan on Thursday at an army base in Srinagar, in Indian-administered Kashmir, calling the neighbouring country an “irresponsible and rogue nation”. “I believe that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency),” Singh said. In response to the minister’s comments, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that Singh had revealed his “profound insecurity and frustration regarding Pakistan’s effective defence and deterrence”. “The comments of India’s Defence Minister also show his sheer ignorance of the mandate and responsibilities of a specialised agency of the United Nations like the IAEA,” it read. “If anything, the IAEA and the international community should be worried about the repeated theft and illicit trafficking incidents involving nuclear and radioactive material in India,” the statement added. The UN nuclear watchdog monitors countries that have nuclear weapons to ensure that they are peaceful. Under a 2008 agreement, the IAEA monitors several Indian civilian nuclear facilities.    After conducting tit-for-tat nuclear tests in 1998, India and Pakistan became nuclear powers, making the region one of the world’s dangerous nuclear flashpoints. Last week, the two countries traded intense missile and drone attacks, leaving nearly 70 people dead. The fighting followed an April 22 rebel attack on Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan – an accusation Islamabad denied. On Saturday, United States President Donald Trump announced a surprise ceasefire agreement as world powers urged the two nuclear powers to avoid escalating tensions. While the ceasefire is currently holding, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that India would strike at militant hideouts across the border again if there were new attacks on India and would not be deterred by what he referred to as Islamabad’s “nuclear blackmail”. However, Pakistan rejected Modi’s statements as being “provocative and inflammatory assertions”, saying they represents a dangerous escalation. Meanwhile, on Thursday, police in Indian-administered Kashmir said they killed three suspected fighters in the town of Tral, in Pulwama district south of Srinagar. Police also said three other suspected fighters died in a gun battle with soldiers on Tuesday in the southern Kashmir valley.

"news","Can President Trump legally accept a $400m plane for free?","15 May 2025","Louis Jacobson and Loreben Tuquero | Politifact","Trump’s $400m plane acceptance from Qatar potentially breaches the US Constitution’s emoluments clause as lawsuits face procedural hurdles. The administration of US President Donald Trump says it has accepted a plane worth an estimated $400m from the state of Qatar. While Trump is president, the White House says it would be used as the new Air Force One, then it would go to Trump’s presidential library after his term ends. The aircraft would become the most expensive gift from a foreign government ever to a US elected official, ABC News reported. But some members of Congress say accepting it would be unconstitutional. When asked about the potential gift at a May 12 executive order signing, Trump blamed Boeing’s lack of progress in building a new Air Force One. He said he would be “stupid” to refuse a free plane, and said he won’t use it after he leaves office. “It’s not a gift to me, it’s a gift to the Department of Defense,” he said. Legal experts told PolitiFact that they believe accepting the gift would violate the US Constitution’s emoluments clause, which reads, “No Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” The emoluments clause was designed “to prevent foreign nations from gaining improper influence” over US leaders, said David Forte, Cleveland State University emeritus law professor. Experts differed on whether accepting the plane would be an impeachable offence. Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor, said that if Trump accepts the gift, it could be an impeachable deed, because it would amount to “a fully corrupt act”. Forte, however, said the gift wouldn’t necessarily amount to a bribe or an impeachable offence, but it “is a form of influence buying designed to gain the gratitude of the recipient by playing to his vanity.”    During Trump’s first term as US president, Congressional Democrats, private individuals and attorneys general from Maryland and Washington, DC, filed lawsuits against Trump stemming from the emoluments clause. However, many of the cases were dismissed on procedural grounds, and the US Supreme Court did not rule on the transactions’ underlying constitutionality. Trump’s possible acceptance of the aircraft is different, said Frank Bowman, a University of Missouri emeritus law professor. In his first term, Trump said payments were made to his businesses. This time, there would be no connection to Trump’s businesses. It would be a gift offered for free with no promise of payment from the president or the US Treasury, Bowman said. NBC News, citing an anonymous senior Justice Department official, reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi approved a memo prepared by the agency’s Office of Legal Counsel that deemed it was legal for the Defense Department to accept the gift. Bondi has previously lobbied on behalf of the state of Qatar. Trump, on his part, has thanked Qatar for the jet. “If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department, during a couple of years while they’re [Boeing is] building the other one, I think that’s a very nice gesture [from Qatar],” he said on May 12. Legal experts said it’s unlikely that Congress, controlled by Republicans, will stop Trump from accepting the gift. Meghan Faulkner, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that since it appears the Justice Department has signed off on receiving the gift, it “could make it harder to hold him accountable”. Bowman said the Justice Department, according to longstanding policy, wouldn’t prosecute a sitting president. Faulkner said Trump stands to benefit again after running out the clock on emoluments challenges during his first term. “Enforcing the emoluments clause in the courts would face similar challenges [in his second term], including the challenge of finding a plaintiff who has standing to challenge the violations,” she said.

"news","Trump says US close to nuclear deal with Iran, but key gaps remain","15 May 2025",NA,"On a regional visit to Gulf countries, the US president signals progress on nuclear talks with Tehran. United States President Donald Trump has claimed Washington is nearing an agreement with Iran to resolve a long-running nuclear dispute, despite ongoing diplomatic hurdles. “We’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,” Trump said in Qatar during the second leg of his Gulf tour on Thursday, before heading to the United Arab Emirates. “We’re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran,” he said. “I think we’re getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this.” Trump said he was basing his optimism on new statements by Iran. “You probably read today the story about Iran. It’s sort of agreed to the terms,” he said. The president did not specify which remarks he was referring to, but an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Ali Shamkhani, said in a US media interview this week that Tehran was willing to accept far-reaching curbs on its nuclear programme. “I want them [Iran] to succeed, I want them to end up being a great country,” Trump added on Thursday, “but they can’t have a nuclear weapon; that’s the only thing, it’s very simple.”    Trump’s remarks come amid intensified negotiations between US and Iranian officials, most recently held in Oman last Sunday. A US official confirmed to Axios that a new proposal had been delivered to Tehran during the fourth round of talks. While both sides say they prefer a diplomatic solution, serious differences remain. On Tuesday, Trump called Tehran the “most destructive force” in the Middle East. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded forcefully to Trump’s remarks, accusing the US of fuelling instability in the region. “Trump thinks he can sanction and threaten us and then talk of human rights. All the crimes and regional instability is caused by them [the United States],” he said. “He wants to create instability inside Iran.” On Thursday, the top commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Hossein Salami, said that Iran considers Trump the “murderer” of Qassem Soleimani, the former commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force. He was killed in Iraq in a drone strike on January 3, 2020 that was ordered by Trump during his first term in office. Yet some signals from Tehran suggest a deal may be within reach. In an interview with NBC News on Wednesday, senior adviser Shamkhani indicated that Iran would be open to curbing its nuclear programme if sanctions were lifted. According to Shamkhani, Iran is prepared to commit to not developing nuclear weapons, diluting its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and accepting international inspections.    Still, major obstacles remain. Washington has insisted that Iran halt uranium enrichment entirely – something Iranian officials continue to reject, calling it a non-negotiable “red line”. Iran is willing to lower enrichment levels and reduce stockpiles, but insists the reductions be gradual and no less than the limits set by the 2015 nuclear agreement, which the previous Trump administration abandoned in 2018. Negotiators are also at odds over where Iran’s excess uranium should be transferred, further complicating talks. Qatar has emerged as a central player in mediation efforts between the US and Iran, as momentum builds around talks to revive a nuclear deal. Speaking in Doha, Trump said Iran should “say a big thank you” to Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who had pressed the US leader to avoid military action. “Iran is very lucky to have the emir because he’s actually fighting for them. He doesn’t want us to do a vicious blow to Iran,” Trump said. Qatar’s involvement “is not really something new”, said Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Doha. “They played quite a crucial role in mediating between the Iranians and the Americans in the past.” According to Ahelbarra, there is a “strong indication” that Qatar will be “enormously involved in mediating a settlement”. On his regional trip, Trump visited Saudi Arabia, where he met Saudi and Syrian leaders on Wednesday, before heading to Qatar. On Thursday, he addressed US troops stationed at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, before heading to Abu Dhabi. In the UAE, he is meeting Emirati leaders who are lobbying Washington for support in their ambitious bid to position the Gulf state as a world leader in artificial intelligence.

"news","Tycoon Mike Lynch’s yacht toppled by ‘extreme wind’, UK investigators say","15 May 2025",NA,"Interim report into sinking of superyacht that killed 7 off coast of Sicily said the vessel was ‘vulnerable’ to strong winds. Investigators in the United Kingdom say a sudden blast of powerful wind was likely behind the capsizing of a superyacht owned by British tech billionaire Mike Lynch, which sank off Sicily last year, killing seven people. Lynch, 59, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah were among those who died when the 56-metre Bayesian overturned in the early hours of August 19. The voyage was meant to be a celebratory outing following Lynch’s acquittal in a major fraud case in the United States just two months earlier. In a preliminary report released on Thursday, the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) found that the vessel was “vulnerable” to strong winds – potentially even less severe than those recorded at the time of the incident. The report noted that this vulnerability was unknown to the yacht’s owner and crew, as it had not been documented in the stability guidance available on board. The agency launched its probe because the Bayesian was registered in the UK. However, it acknowledged that access to key evidence remains limited due to an ongoing criminal inquiry by Italian authorities.    According to the UK report, the Bayesian had been moved the day before the accident to what was believed to be a safer location in anticipation of thunderstorms. But at about 4:06am local time, with the vessel in a motoring state, sails stowed and the centreboard raised, it was hit by winds exceeding 70 knots (81 mph), which caused it to capsize within seconds. “You have the wind pushing the vessel over and then you have the stability of the vessel trying to push the vessel back upright again,” said MAIB investigator Simon Graves. “What our studies found was that the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds, and these winds were likely present at the time of the accident.” Among the other victims were Jonathan and Judy Bloomer – both British nationals – Chris and Neda Morvillo from the US, and Canadian Antiguan chef Recaldo Thomas. Fifteen people survived, including Lynch’s wife, Angela Bacares. Efforts to recover the yacht have stalled since May 9, when a diver was killed during the operation. Salvage work resumed on Thursday. Graves said the final report will cover additional factors such as possible escape routes and what took place on board. “There’s still more to uncover,” he said. “Once we gain access to the yacht itself, we’ll be able to paint a fuller picture of the timeline and decisions made.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/15/tycoon-mike-lynchs-yacht-toppled-by-extreme-wind-uk-investigators-say"
"news","What’s at stake in US Supreme Court birthright citizenship case?","15 May 2025",NA,"Ruling could transform US policy on birthright citizenship, or limit federal judge’s ability to curtail Trump. It was one of US President Donald Trump’s most ambitious executive orders, and it came just hours after he took office for his second term: ending the United States’ policy of birthright citizenship that has lasted for more than a century. And just three days after Trump issued the order, a federal judge in Washington state blocked the decree from going into effect. In the months that followed, two other federal judges joined in issuing nationwide injunctions. On Thursday, the issue will reach the US Supreme Court, with the 6-3 conservative dominated bench set to hear oral arguments in the case. What the court decides could be transformative. Proponents have long argued that the practice of granting citizenship to all those born on US soil is woven into the national fabric. American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony Romero did not mince words in January, when he called Trump’s order a “reckless and ruthless repudiation of American values”, destined to create a “permanent subclass of people born in the US who are denied full rights as Americans”. Meanwhile, a smaller but vocal contingency, empowered by Trump, has maintained that the practice is based on faulty constitutional interpretation and serves as an incentive for undocumented migration. The Trump administration has called it “birth tourism”. Here’s what to expect from Thursday’s hearing: The hearing will start at 9am local (14:00 GMT). The most fundamental question that could be answered by the top court is whether birthright citizenship will be allowed to continue. Proponents point to the US Constitution’s 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, which reads: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside”. A subsequent 1898 Supreme Court case, United States v Wong Kim Ark, interpreted the language as applying to all immigrants, creating a precedent that has since stood.    Some studies estimate that about 150,000 immigrant infants are born with citizenship every year under the policy. The Trump administration, in contrast, has embraced the theory that babies born to noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the US, and therefore are not constitutionally guaranteed citizenship. Speaking to reporters in April, Trump described a scenario of “tourists coming in and touching a piece of sand and then all of a sudden, there’s citizenship”. He has embraced the theory that the 14th Amendment was meant to apply only to former slaves, and not newly arriving immigrants At the time, Trump predicted it would be “easy” to win the case based on that logic. Yes. The Trump administration has taken a strategically unique tack in the case. In their emergency filing to the Supreme Court, they have focused on the actions of the three judges who blocked Trump’s order from going into effect nationwide. They argue the orders extend beyond the judges’ authorities and should only apply to the plaintiffs or jurisdictions directly connected to Trump’s executive order. Theoretically, the Supreme Court could rule on whether the judges can issue nationwide injunctions, without ruling on whether birthright citizenship is, in fact, protected by the Constitution.    For example, if the justices rule that the lower judges exceeded their power, but do not make a determination on the constitutional merits of birthright citizenship, the executive order would only be blocked in the 22 states that successfully challenged Trump’s order. Attorneys General in those states had challenged the order in a joint lawsuit, with a federal judge in Massachusetts ruling in their favour in February. Birthright citizenship would effectively be banned in 28 other states unless they also successfully challenge the order or until the Supreme Court makes a future ruling. The possibility has split legal scholars, with some arguing it is unlikely the Supreme Court would make the narrower decision on the scope of the lower judges’ power without also ruling on the underlying constitutional merits of birthright citizenship. Yes. If the justices do decide to only address the scope of the lower judges’ power, the implications could extend far beyond the birthright citizenship question. It would also apply to several other Trump executive orders that have been blocked by a federal judge’s national injunction, also called “universal injunctions”. Those include several Trump executive orders seeking to unilaterally transform the federal government, the military, and how funding is disbursed to states, to name a few.    In a written filing in the birthright citizenship case, the Department of Justice pointed to the wider implications, saying the need for the Supreme Court’s “intervention has become urgent as universal injunctions have reached tsunami levels”. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs in the Maryland case that successfully challenged Trump’s birthright order said doing away with national injunctions would create different tiers of rights depending on an individual’s geographical location. “An infant would be a United States citizen and full member of society if born in New Jersey, but a deportable noncitizen if born in Tennessee,” they wrote in a court filing.

"news","India says its troops killed 31 Maoist rebels in weeks-long battle","15 May 2025",NA,"The 21-day army operation was part of India’s offensive against the last remaining groups of the Naxalite rebellion. Indian security forces have killed 31 Maoist rebels in what the country’s home minister called the “biggest operation against Naxalism”. Amit Shah said on social media on Wednesday that the operation took place on Karreguttalu Hill on the border of Chhattisgarh and Telangana. “The hill on which the red terror once reigned, today the tricolour is flying proudly … Our security forces completed this biggest anti-Naxal operation in just 21 days and I am extremely happy that there was not a single casualty in the security forces in this operation,” he wrote on X. India has been waging an offensive against the last remaining groups of the Naxalite rebellion, a far-left Maoist-inspired fighter movement that began in 1967. The Karreguttalu Hills used to be the unified headquarters of several Naxalite organisations, where rebels were provided weapons and strategic training. But the Naxalites have been fighting for what they say is the defence of the rights of the tribal people in the region. At the group’s peak in the mid-2000s, they controlled nearly a third of the country with an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 fighters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed the news of the success of the operation. “This success of the security forces shows that our campaign towards rooting out Naxalism is moving in the right direction,” Modi wrote on X. “We are fully committed to establishing peace in the Naxal-affected areas and connecting them with the mainstream of development.” Director General Central Reserve Police Force GP Singh also said on Wednesday that the government is “committed to eliminate” Naxalism by March 31, 2026 “through relentless and ruthless operations”. According to government data, since last year, Indian soldiers have killed at least 400 rebels. More recently, 11 rebels were killed by Indian troops in the states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. In February, security forces killed 11 fighters and killed a further 30 in March. Moreover, according to a news release by the Foreign Office, 718 Naxalites have so far surrendered in the first four months of 2025.

A 23-year-old Mexican influencer, Valeria Marquez, was fatally shot on Tuesday while livestreaming on TikTok from her beauty salon in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Marquez, who had more than 113,000 followers on the platform, was broadcasting to her audience when the attack occurred.     According to a statement from the Jalisco state prosecutor’s office, the case is being investigated under femicide protocols, applied in instances where a woman is killed due to her gender. As of Wednesday, Marquez’s TikTok account appeared to have been removed. Here is what we know: Marquez was working inside Blossom The Beauty Lounge when the attack happened. She was livestreaming on TikTok at the time. In the video, she is seen sitting at a table, holding a stuffed pink pig toy, and is heard saying, “He is coming.” A man’s voice in the background then asks, “Hi, are you Valeria?” to which she replies, “Yes.” At that moment, she turns off the microphone, and seconds later, she is shot dead. The man whose voice was previously heard is not visible in the video. According to reports, the man who shot her then hopped onto a motorbike and fled. Meanwhile, on the video – still being streamed live – Valeria is seen grabbing her chest and stomach before she collapses in her chair. She appears to have been shot twice, with at least one bullet hitting her torso. The face of another woman briefly appears before the video ends. Earlier in the same video, Valeria revealed information that has set off speculation over a possible link to the events leading to her death. “Hey, what do you think happened to me?” she says. “I was doing some things today, and Erika called me and said, ‘Hey, babe, they’re bringing you something, and I don’t know what, but they want to give it to you.’” It’s unclear who Erika is. I said, ‘Oh, I’ll be there in about an hour,’ and the delivery guy said, ‘I’d better wait for her because it’s really expensive.’ “Who’s going to give me something?” she asked on the video. In the livestream, she said at another point, “Dude, they might’ve been about to kill me.” It’s unclear who she’s referring to or what prompted her to say this. According to authorities, she was still in the chair, holding onto the stuffed pig, when they arrived. The crime is now being investigated as the eighth femicide so far this month in Jalisco. According to local media, Valeria rose to fame on social media thanks to her content about beauty, lifestyle and entrepreneurship. She had more than 113,000 followers on TikTok and at least 70,000 followers on Instagram. She owned the beauty salon located in Zapopan, where she shared aesthetic tips and personal moments with her audience. She opened it in 2024. According to the publication El Financiero, in 2021, Marquez was crowned Miss Rostro, a local beauty contest, which solidified her presence in the world of modelling and beauty. In addition to her professional career, she maintained a close relationship with her followers, openly sharing details about her personal life. According to the latest data from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Mexico shares the fourth-highest femicide rate in the region, tied with Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia, at 1.3 deaths per 100,000 women in 2023. The top three are Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Brazil.  Jalisco is ranked sixth out of Mexico’s 32 states, including Mexico City, for homicides, with 906 recorded there since the beginning of President Claudia Sheinbaum’s term in October 2024, according to the data consultancy TResearch. The United Nations says that about 10 women or girls are murdered every day in Mexico According to AFP, Zapopan Mayor Juan Jose Frangie stated that his office had no record of Marquez seeking assistance from authorities regarding any threats. He added that “femicide is the worst thing”. This killing took place just days before another woman, a mayoral candidate in the state of Veracruz, was also shot dead during a livestream alongside three other people. President Sheinbaum, in a statement, said she had no information yet about the motive.

"news","Claudia Sheinbaum denounces proposed US remittance tax as ‘unacceptable’","15 May 2025",NA,"Republicans have proposed the remittance tax as part of a broader push to crack down on undocumented immigration. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has denounced a provision in a tax bill being considered in the United States Congress that would impose duties on remittances — a term used to describe the money people send abroad for non-commercial reasons, often as gifts to family and loved ones. On Thursday, during her morning news conference, Sheinbaum addressed the tax bill directly, calling the remittances proposal “a measure that is unacceptable”. “It would result in double taxation, since Mexicans living in the United States already pay taxes,” she said. She added that her government was reaching out to other countries with large immigrant populations to voice concern about the US proposition. “This will not just affect Mexico,” she said. “It will also affect many other countries and many other Latin American countries.” According to World Bank data from 2024, India is the top recipient of international remittances, with $129bn coming from abroad, followed by Mexico with more than $68bn. In Mexico, in particular, experts estimate that remittances make up close to 4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). But a far-reaching tax bill championed by US President Donald Trump includes language that would impose a 5-percent excise tax on remittances sent specifically by non-citizens, including visa holders and permanent residents. That bill would affect nearly 40 million people living in the country. US citizens, however, would be exempt from the remittance tax. Trump has led a campaign to discourage immigration to the US and promote “mass deportation” during his second term in office, as part of his “America First” agenda. Proponents of that platform say taxing remittances would serve as clear deterrence to immigrants who come to the US looking for better economic opportunities for themselves and any loved ones they hope to support back home. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank, told The Associated Press news agency that he believes barriers to remittances can help curb undocumented immigration to the US. “One of the main reasons people come here is to work and send money home,” Krikorian said. “If that’s much more difficult to do, it becomes less appealing to come here.” Under the bill being weighed in the House of Representatives, the 5-percent tax would be paid by the sender and collected by “remittance transfer providers”, who would then send that money to the US Treasury. But President Sheinbaum and other leaders have called on Republicans in Congress to reconsider that provision, given the unintended consequences it could create. Sheinbaum even suggested that the tax could be seen as unconstitutional in the US. “This is an injustice, apart from being unconstitutional,” she said on Thursday. “But in addition, it is the tax on those who have the least. They should charge taxes to those at the top, not those at the bottom.” Critics of the measure point out that remittances can help stabilise impoverished areas abroad, thereby limiting the likelihood of undocumented migration from those areas. Additional barriers to sending remittances could create economic setbacks for those communities, not to mention make the process more difficult for US citizens who are exempted from the proposed tax. Still, even if the tax bill is defeated or the provision on remittances removed, the Trump administration has signalled it plans to move forward with other measures designed to discourage migrants from sending funds abroad. On April 25, Trump posted on his media platform, Truth Social, a list of “weekly policy achievements”. On the final page, the top bullet point under “international relations” was “finalizing a Presidential Memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside the United States”. Trump called the document a “MUST READ”.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/15/claudia-sheinbaum-denounces-proposed-us-remittance-tax-as-unacceptable"
"news","‘They’ll be back’: White Afrikaners leave South Africa to be refugees in US","15 May 2025","Qaanitah Hunter","Trump administration welcomes first batch of white Afrikaners while US cuts off refugee programmes to other countries. Johannesburg, South Africa – On a chilly Sunday evening in Johannesburg, OR Tambo International Airport was filled with tourists and travellers entering and exiting South Africa’s busiest airport. On one side of the international departures hall, a few dozen people queued – their trollies piled with luggage, travel pillows and children’s blankets – as they waited to board a charter flight to Washington Dulles International Airport in the United States. Dressed casually and comfortably for the 13-hour journey that would follow, the group – most young, all white – talked among themselves while avoiding onlookers. Although they blended into the bustling terminal around them, these weren’t ordinary travellers. They were Afrikaners leaving South Africa to be refugees in Donald Trump’s America. When Charl Kleinhaus first applied for refugee resettlement in the US earlier this year, he told officials he had been threatened and that people attempted to claim his property. The 46-year-old, who claimed to own a farm in Limpopo, South Africa’s northernmost province, was not required to present proof of these threats or provide details regarding when the alleged incidents occurred. On Sunday, he joined dozens of others accepted by the Trump administration as part of a pilot programme granting asylum to people from the Afrikaner community – descendants of mainly Dutch colonisers that led the brutal apartheid regime for nearly five decades. The Trump administration claims white people face discrimination in South Africa – a country where they make up some 7 percent of the population but own more than 70 percent of the land and occupy the majority of top management positions. “I want you all to know that you are really welcome here and that we respect what you have had to deal with these last few years,” US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau told Kleinhaus and the others when they landed at the Dulles International in Virginia. “We respect the long tradition of your people and what you have accomplished over the years,” he said on Monday. Speaking to a journalist at the airport, Kleinhaus said he never expected “this land expropriation thing to go so far” in South Africa. He was referring to the recently passed Expropriation Act, which allows the South African government to, in exceptional circumstances, take land for public use without compensation. Pretoria says the measure is aimed at redressing apartheid injustices, as Black South Africans who make up more than 80 percent of the population still own just 4 percent of the land. South African officials say the law has not resulted in any land grabs. There is also no record of Kleinhaus’s property being expropriated. Kleinhaus was unaffected by any threats and the government was unaware of anyone who might have threatened his property, Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told Al Jazeera. “The people of South Africa have not been affected by the expropriation of land. There’s no evidence. None of them are affected by any farm murders either,” the minister emphasised. In February, when Trump signed an executive order granting refugee status to Afrikaners, he cited widely discredited claims that their land was being seized and that they were being brutally killed in South Africa. On Monday, Trump again claimed that Afrikaners were victims of a “genocide” – an accusation South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and other experts maintain is based on lies. “Farmers are being killed,” Trump told reporters. “White farmers are being brutally killed, and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.” Ramaphosa has also debunked claims that the group who left this week faced any persecution at home. “They are leaving because they do not wish to embrace the democratic transformation unfolding in South Africa,” he said. For 60-year-old Sam Busa, watching Kleinhaus and the 48 other South Africans leave to be resettled in the US was a hopeful moment. Busa, who has also applied for asylum, is waiting in anticipation for an interview that would qualify her for resettlement. She has begun selling excess household items in anticipation of her new life in the US. The semi-retired businesswoman has been at the forefront of efforts – through a website called Amerikaners – encouraging Afrikaners to take an interest in the US offer to grant refugee status on the grounds that they face racial persecution in South Africa. When asked how she has experienced persecution because of her race, Busa recounted an incident where she was held at gunpoint at her home in Johannesburg – the commercial capital of South Africa and one of the most dangerous cities in the world. She later moved to KwaZulu-Natal on the country’s east coast, where she ran a business that provided services to the government. When asked whether she believed she was targeted because of her race or if she was simply a victim of common crime, Busa asserted it did not matter. She didn’t feel safe, she said. “I am not overly sensitive. When I watch Julius Malema singing about killing the Boer, it is extremely terrifying.” Malema, the far-left leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) political party, often sings a famous anti-apartheid song, Kill the Boer (Boer meaning farmer in Afrikaans), which the courts have ruled is not hate speech or an incitement to violence. For Busa, much like Kleinhaus, new legislation passed to bolster racial transformation, which includes having specific hiring targets for employment equity, has been “the straw that broke the camel’s back”. “Expropriation without compensation is a huge issue, along with the amendment to employment equity,” she said, restating her belief that white people don’t have a future in South Africa. “It’s coming hard and fast, and it’s becoming clear to [white] South Africans that we struggle with fears of home invasion. I don’t live on a farm, but there are massive fears because of the constant threat of crime. It has become clear to white South Africans; it’s not disguised,” she claimed. The narrative of fear is prevalent among those engaged in the refugee programme despite the fact that several experts have debunked the assertion that they were victims of racially motivated attacks and not common crime. South Africa sees about 19,000 murders a year. According to data from the police, most victims of rural crime are Black, with evidence showing that white farmers are not disproportionately being killed. Meanwhile, many participants in the US’s Afrikaner refugee resettlement programme do not even live on farms; many are urban dwellers, according to Minister Ntshavheni. Katia Beedan, who lives in Cape Town, is also anticipating resettlement in the US. She told Al Jazeera that refugee hopefuls do not have to prove racial persecution but simply articulate it. “For me, it’s racial persecution and political persecution,” she said about her reasons for wanting to leave South Africa. The copywriter-turned-life coach pointed to racial transformation laws targeting employment equity and land expropriation, which she believes the government is “overwhelming us with”, as a key reason for her desire to flee. However, many other South Africans see sections of the Afrikaner community – including their right-wing lobby groups like AfriForum that first pushed the false narrative of a “white genocide” – as struggling to exist equally in a country where they were once considered superior because of their race. “I think AfriForum is struggling with the reality of being ordinary,” social justice activist and South Africa’s former public protector, Thuli Madonsela, told local TV channel, Newzroom Afrika, in March. “The new South Africa requires all of us to be ordinary, whereas colonialism and apartheid made white people special people. “I think some white people … [are] seeking to reverse the wheel and find reason to be special again. They seem to have found an ally in the American president,” she said. In February, as Trump expedited efforts to resettle Afrikaners in the US, he was closing off his country’s refugee programme to other asylum seekers from war-torn and famine-stricken parts of the world. For Loren Landau from the African Centre for Migration and Society at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, the Afrikaner refugee relocation is “absurd and ridiculous”. “They have not been welcomed as tourists or work permit holders, but as refugees. The idea of a refugee system is to protect those who cannot be safeguarded by their own states and who fear persecution or violence because of who they are or their membership in a social group. Can Afrikaners make that case?” he asked. Although “there are people in South Africa who discriminate against them,” and Afrikaners now “have less privilege and protection than during the apartheid era”, it cannot be said that this is indicative of state policy, he said, adding that many different people are robbed, killed, and face discrimination in South Africa. “Are they [Afrikaners] specially victimised because of who they are? Absolutely not!” Landau added. He said all statistics on land ownership, income, and education levels indicate that South Africa’s white population far outstrips others: “They are still by far in the top strata of South African society. No one is taking their land. No one is taking their cars.” Even fringe groups that may have called for land grabs have done little to enact their threats, observers note. However, for Busa, that doesn’t matter. “I fear for my children. You never know when the EFF decides they want you dead. It’s not a country I want to live in,” she said. The EFF has said those who decide to leave South Africa should have their citizenship revoked. Confronted with the implications of this situation, the government is considering whether those who exit as refugees could easily return to the country. Ramaphosa is expected to discuss the ongoing matter with Trump at a meeting in the US next week. Meanwhile, for the Afrikaners now in the US, most will settle in Texas, with others in New York, Idaho, Iowa and North Carolina, while the government helps them find work and accommodation. They will hold refugee status for one year, after which they can apply for a US green card to make them permanent residents. At the same time, the Afrikaner resettlement programme remains open to others who want to apply. When Kleinhaus and his group arrived in the US on Monday, they had smiles on their faces as they met officials and waved US flags. Yet, for South Africa’s president, their resettlement in the US marks “a sad moment for them” – and something he believes may not last. “As South Africans, we are resilient. We don’t run away from our problems,” he said at an agricultural exhibition in Free State province on Monday. “If you look at all national groups in our country, Black and white, they’ve stayed in this country because it’s our country. “I can bet you that they [the Afrikaners who left] will be back soon because there is no country like South Africa.”             Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/15/theyll-be-back-white-afrikaners-leave-south-africa-to-be-refugees-in-us"
"news","Russia grabs a bit more of Ukraine as it heads into peace talks","15 May 2025","John T Psaropoulos","On eve of Istanbul peace talks, Moscow ignored a US-EU call for a 30-day ceasefire and showed signs of preparing for new offensives. Russian forces made creeping advances through Ukraine’s east this week, as the two countries prepared to hold their first direct talks in three years on Thursday. Russian forces captured the settlement of Kotlyarivka, southwest of the embattled area of Pokrovsk, on Monday, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said.     The seizure brought Russian forces to within 3.7km (2.3 miles) of the regional border between Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk in Ukraine. Russian forces also forced their way into the village of Myrolyubivka, east of Pokrovsk, and claimed to have taken the entire settlement. On Wednesday, Russia’s Defence Ministry claimed its forces took the community of Mykhailovka, also in Donetsk. These were minor advances, but showed there was no letup in Russia’s effort to take all of Donetsk and other regions it partly occupies, even as it prepared to go into peace talks. According to Ukrainian military intelligence, Russia was even moving troops into position for a major new offensive, the United Kingdom’s Financial Times reported. US President Donald Trump called for a 30-day ceasefire on May 8. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, flanked by the leaders of Poland, Germany, France and Britain, backed that demand on Saturday. Despite telling Western reporters Russia would “think about that”, the Kremlin ended up insisting on peace talks without a ceasefire, accusing Ukraine of violating previous ceasefires it announced unilaterally. Instead, Putin proposed peace talks without conditions at a dawn media conference on Sunday. “We are not ruling out that during these talks we will be able to agree on some new ceasefire, a new truce,” he said. Zelenskyy has said he would attend the talks in Istanbul if Putin does as well. Putin was expected after his spokesman said Russia would attend “at the corresponding” level, but then his name did not appear on a list of delegates Russia provided. “If Putin does not show up – if this is another game – it will clearly demonstrate that Russia is not ready to end the war,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media, calling for a new sanctions package in that case. As of Wednesday night, he was saying: “I am waiting to see who will come from Russia, and then I will decide which steps Ukraine should take.” US President Donald Trump, currently on a Middle East tour, is claiming credit for this diplomatic initiative. “I insisted that that meeting take place and it is taking place,” he said. Trump dispatched his Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and said he “was thinking of actually flying over. There’s a possibility of it, I guess, if I think things can happen.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will host the talks. “I think we have a window of opportunity this week and in the next 10 days – two weeks – to bring the issue of Ukraine to a more constructive level,” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told Turkiye’s Anadolu news agency. There appeared to be a connection between Putin’s meetings with foreign leaders on Saturday, and his peace talks proposal at dawn on Sunday. At 1:30am [22:30 GMT] on Sunday morning, he was still in talks with the leader of South Ossetia, a breakaway region of Georgia. It was the last of four days of meetings with 23 leaders who came to Moscow for the May 9 parade to celebrate the end of the second world war. At 4am [01:00 GMT], he alerted the media that he would announce “the results of international events to mark the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany”. When he invited Ukraine to peace talks in Turkiye less than two hours later, he also thanked foreign partners for their “peace-oriented efforts”, Kremlin newswire TASS reported. Zelenskyy said Ukraine had received a message of support for its call for a 30-day ceasefire from China, perhaps a sign that China privately put pressure on Putin to pursue peace. There were strong headwinds going into the talks, however. Putin’s language when announcing the talks was not friendly. “The ball is now in the court of the Kyiv government and its curators, who are guided by political ambitions – not their people’s interests – in their desire to continue the conflict with Russia with the hands of Ukrainian nationalists,” he said, a reference to European governments, which have been less keen than the Trump administration to push Ukraine into talks. Russia is taking a hard line going in. On Tuesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Russia would insist on the “denazification of the Kyiv regime”, Moscow’s way of describing Zelenskyy’s removal from office, and recognition of “current realities on the ground” – ie, there will be no territorial concessions. On Tuesday, almost on the eve of talks in Istanbul on Thursday, Putin was selling Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine to investors at the Delovaya Rossiya (Business Russia) association, implying there would be no territorial concessions. “There is something to invest in there. There are such lands, fertile in terms of agriculture and favourable in terms of tourism development,” he said. On Wednesday, Russian ambassador-at-large Rodion Miroshnik told reporters that negotiations need not go further than the Istanbul proposals of 2022. That was when Russia attempted to impose a capitulation agreement in March and April of 2022, when a Russian invasion force threatened to take Kyiv. It named Russia and China as Ukraine’s security guarantors, cut down Ukraine’s armed forces to 85,000 personnel, less than one-tenth of the current Ukrainian army, and forbade Ukraine from joining foreign alliances such as NATO. “Let’s go back, make adjustments to it that have emerged over the past three years and after that we will move to signing this document,” Miroshnik said. The Western position ahead of talks has also been hard on Russia. On the day of Putin’s parade, some 40 world leaders gathered in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv to celebrate the end of World War II and announced a tribunal to try Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The tribunal was to be launched in Luxembourg this week, when the Council of Europe was to convene. On Tuesday, the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization officially held Russia responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014. Pro-Russian separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine used a Russian Buk air defence system to down the plane in July that year, killing all 298 people on board. On Wednesday this week, the European Union agreed on a 17th sanctions package restricting 200 tankers used by Russia to evade a ban on its oil exports to the EU, bringing Moscow tens of billions in illicit dollars. EU foreign ministers are expected to put the sanctions into force on May 20. European commissioner for economic affairs Valdis Dombrovskis said work would begin immediately on an 18th package. On Monday, Poland shut down Russia’s consulate in Krakow, after investigators determined that a fire that destroyed the Marywilska shopping centre last year was the work of Russian saboteurs.

"news","Romania braces for heated presidential vote after controversial annulment","15 May 2025","Madeleine Cuckson","Al Jazeera interviews the two candidates who will battle it out on Sunday after the controversial annulment of the 2024 vote. Bucharest, Romania – Romania is heading towards its most polarised presidential election in the country’s democratic history, with voters braced for the battle between a right-wing populist and a centrist technocrat on Sunday. Recent polls show the race is close, with only a few percentage points separating the two candidates – George Simion, leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) and Nicusor Dan, an independent and the current mayor of Bucharest, where 25 percent of the country’s 19 million citizens live. Simion aligns himself with populist leaders such as the United States’s Donald Trump and Hungary’s anti-immigrant leader Viktor Orban. The vote comes at a critical time for Romania, a member of the European Union and NATO that borders Ukraine. Western countries are currently struggling to agree on support for Kyiv – with Washington’s backing for the war-torn nation in doubt, a strategy to deal with the fallout from increased US tariffs, and on how to deal with Russia as it continues to wage war and scold European heads of state. The 38-year-old Simion secured 40 percent of the vote in a first round on May 4. Dan, a former mathematician, followed with about 20 percent. The first round came in the wake of the controversial annulment of Romania’s October 2024 presidential election, in which ultranationalist underdog candidate Calin Georgescu advanced to the final. The constitutional court cited reasons of irregular financing and suspected foreign interference. Simion has promised to redo the second round of the 2024 election if the Romanian public so desires. A supporter of banned candidate Georgescu, Simion is likely to have swept up much of his base in the first round and has spoken of promoting Georgescu to the role of prime minister. “After the annulment, completely abusive and unfounded, of the [2024] elections, Romanians have seen the ugliest face of this deep state that decides beyond the will of the people,” Simion told Al Jazeera. A divisive figure, he is banned from entering Ukraine and Moldova. He has previously called to restore Romania’s old borders. He is also sceptical about sending more military aid to Ukraine. He has organised nationalist rallies in the past, as well as demonstrations against corruption. He founded AUR in 2020. “I have promised that the first thing I will do as president is to unseal the files on the annulment of the elections. To do justice, we must know the truth,” said Simion. Romania’s 2024 election fallout earned the nation criticism from high-profile populists who claimed free speech was being threatened. US Vice President JD Vance condemned the annulment at the Munich Security Conference, saying the ruling was based on the “flimsy suspicions of an intelligence agency”. Political analyst Anamaria-Nicoleta Ciobanu defined Simion as a “chameleonic leader” who began his career as a moderate, but has since shifted towards the hard right. “Most of Simion’s voters are not extremists; they are only disappointed in how the Romanian political and economic space looks”, she said. Simion maintains an official stance of neutrality on the Ukraine war, but voters tend to be drawn to his anti-establishment message. “The establishment, made by old socialist and liberal parties, which have been in power for 35 years, has always talked about ensuring stability. This stability has turned out to be not just an illusion, but a huge lie. Romania has been recently downgraded to a hybrid regime,” Simion told Al Jazeera. In 2024, Romania was moved down 12 places to number 72 in a Democracy Index published by The Economist, falling out of the category “flawed democracy” and into “hybrid regime”, a mixture of authoritarianism and democracy. Despite committing to staying in both the EU and NATO, Simion is critical of Europe. “The federalist super-state that the globalist left is creating is not what European citizens want,” he said. Last week, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu from the Party of European Socialists (PSD) resigned following his government coalition’s failure to secure their candidate, Crin Antonescu, in the run-off. The failure was something of a political earthquake – the first time in the country’s 35-year post-revolutionary history that a leading party has not reached the final. With Ciolacu gone, the incoming president will have the power to nominate a new prime minister. If that figure fails to win parliamentary approval, Romania could face snap parliamentary elections. Dan called Prime Minister Ciolacu’s resignation “long overdue”, in an interview with Al Jazeera. Dan built his reputation as an anticorruption crusader, founded and later walked away from the Save Romania Union party in 2015, which he called the “first large-scale national party arguing for profound reform and modernisation of the political establishment in Romania”. Drawing most of his support from Romania’s urban centres, Dan positions himself as a bulwark against the rising tide of populism. “I’m now running as an independent, specifically because Romanians are distrustful of traditional party structures and their vested interests”, Dan stated. Independent candidates do not receive state-subsidised campaign funding. Dan’s team raised 600,000 euros ($670,000) to support the campaign. After trailing Simion by nearly 20 percent in the first round, he needs a large dose of support to win Sunday’s run-off. “I sympathise entirely with voters feeling left behind,” Dan told Al Jazeera. Last year’s election scandal showed Romanians to be “torn between fear and hope, between turning inward and moving forward”, he said. “Romanians expressed a deep desire for honesty, competence, and a leadership that respects both our European identity and our national dignity,” he said. Dan’s presidential priorities include tackling tax evasion, fraud, drug trafficking, and creating conditions for Romania’s large diaspora of up to five million people, about 25 percent of Romanian citizens, to return home. In the first round, a record number of diaspora Romanians turned out to vote, up 24 percent from last year. Of 966,000 voters, 60 percent supported Simion, while 25 percent supported Dan. Simion voter Sherghei, a 47-year-old Moldova-born Romanian citizen in Norway, made his choice clear on May 4. “I like how Simion fights with the world, together at protests,” he told Al Jazeera. “The diaspora is tired of working abroad, we all hope for a change, we want to go home.” According to political analyst Ciobanu, Romania’s international reputation is at stake. “George Simion is perceived as illiberal, and that can affect our country’s image, foreign affairs and economy even before he acts on his discourse.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/15/romania-braces-for-heated-presidential-vote-after-controversial-annulment"
"news","Al-Qaeda affiliate claims 200 soldiers killed in Burkina Faso attack","15 May 2025",NA,"Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) claims attack on Djibo military outpost, SITE Intelligence Group says. An al-Qaeda affiliate has claimed it killed 200 soldiers in an attack on a Burkina Faso army base this week, according to an NGO that tracks armed groups’ online activity. The base in the northern town of Djibo came under attack on Sunday morning, and a police station and market were also targeted, security sources told the news agency Reuters. Although there was no official toll, three Djibo residents told Reuters that dozens of soldiers and civilians were killed. Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the death toll. A Burkina Faso military source told Al Jazeera that the armed group was exaggerating the number of casualties. The United States-based SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks online activity of armed groups, said Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) made the claim in a formal statement. “The operation comes amid increased JNIM activity in Burkina Faso over the past month inflicting a high number of casualties,” SITE said. The organisation previously said Ousmane Dicko, head of JNIM in Burkina Faso, had appeared in a video urging residents of Djibo to leave the town for their own safety. Reporting from Dakar, Senegal, Al Jazeera’s Nicolas Haque said the attack took place over a number of days. “One of the major military outposts that was supposed to protect this town of about 200,000 people was razed to the ground, such was the firepower of the armed groups,” said Al Jazeera’s Nicolas Haque, reporting from Senegal, Dakar. “This is one of the deadliest attacks in Burkina Faso, and it comes just as Ibrahim Traore [Burkina Faso’s military leader] has been saying that the country has been gaining territory, encouraging people to go back to their homes, but this latest attack proves the opposite,” said Haque. A video circulating on social media from the al-Qaeda affiliate warned people to leave their homes and said it would seize more territories. “What we’re seeing here is the pivot point where these armed groups that normally attack villages are now trying to take over towns. It’s a major blow for Burkina Faso’s armed forces,” Haque said, noting the attacks come just as Traore was visiting Russia, asking President Vladimir Putin for more training and arms to fight off armed groups.    JNIM claimed responsibility for another assault this week targeting a military post in Burkina Faso’s northern Loroum province in which the group said 60 soldiers were killed, according to SITE. The attacks highlight the difficulties the three Sahel nations of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, ruled by military leaders, are facing in containing the armed groups. Burkina Faso authorities have not commented on the latest attacks. A notable attack occurred in the Burkina town of Sole, where JNIM fighters raided the army military post and killed soldiers, SITE Intelligence said, without specifying on which day it took place. A Military government took power in Burkina Faso in 2022, but they have largely failed to provide stability, as more than 60 percent of the country is estimated to be outside government control.

"features","In Gaza, the Nakba is being relived in 2025","15 May 2025","Ruwaida Amer","Ruwaida Amer’s grandparents lived through the Nakba in 1948. Now, in 2025, she is experiencing another catastrophe. The Nakba. It’s a concept that accompanied me from birth until I lived through it myself these past two years. I was born a refugee in the Khan Younis camp, known by the city’s residents as the largest gathering of refugees expelled from their lands during the Nakba, when Israel was founded in 1948. Whenever someone asked me my name, it was always followed by: “Are you a refugee or a citizen?”    As a child, I would ask: “What is a refugee?” I attended a school run by UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, and my documents always had to include proof that I was a refugee. I received treatment at UNRWA clinics, always needing to bring that refugee card. I spent a lot of time trying to understand what being a refugee meant. How did my grandparents flee their land in Beit Daras, a village north of the Gaza Strip that no longer exists? How did my grandfather end up in this camp, and why did he choose this place? Before Israel’s war on Gaza, May 15, or Nakba Day, the day Palestinians commemorate the Nakba, was a unique occasion. Everyone paid attention to it, seeking out people who had lived through it to hear their stories. When I began working as a journalist in 2015, Nakba Day was one of the events I looked forward to covering. That year, I went along with colleagues to the Shati camp, west of Gaza City. It would be my first time writing about the Nakba, and my first visit to a refugee camp in 13 years, since we had moved from camp life to village life in al-Fukhari, south of Khan Younis. When I entered the camp, memories of my childhood in Khan Younis came flooding back: the small, crowded houses, some newly built, others still original structures. It was nice that the commemoration falls in May, with good weather. Elderly men and women sat by their doors, just as my grandmother did when I was a child. I used to love sitting with her; she seemed used to open spaces, like her pre-1948 home in Beit Daras. We sat with elderly women, all over 70. They talked about their homeland, the stability they had in their lands, their simple lives, the food they grew and ate, and the heartbreak of not being able to return. We met many – from Majdal, Hamama, and al-Jura, all depopulated villages and towns taken over by Israel in 1948. Whenever I met someone from Beit Daras, we’d share memories, and laugh a lot, talking about the maftoul (Palestinian couscous) the town was famous for. The visit was light-hearted, filled with laughter and nostalgia, despite these people having been forced into camp life after the occupation drove them from their towns in horrific ways. I began to understand those Nakba stories more deeply when my grandfather began to tell me his own story. He became the central character in my Nakba reports every year, until his death in 2021. He estimated he was about 15 years old at the time. He was already married to my grandmother, and they had a child. He would describe the scenes as I sat in awe, asking myself: How could the world have stood by silently? My grandfather told me they had a good life, working their farm, eating from their crops. Each town had a specialty, and they exchanged produce. Theirs was a simple cuisine, with lots of lentils and bread made from wheat they ground in stone mills. Until that dreadful displacement. He said the Zionist militias forced them to leave, ordering them to go to nearby Gaza. My grandfather said he shut the door to his home, took my grandmother and their son – just a few months old – and started walking. Israeli planes hovered overhead, firing at people as if to drive them to move faster. The baby – my uncle – didn’t survive the journey. My grandfather never wanted to go into the details, he would only say that their son died from the conditions as they fled. After hours of walking, they reached Khan Younis and, with nowhere else to go, he pitched a tent. Eventually, UNRWA was set up and gave him a home, the one I remember from my childhood. It was so old; I spent years visiting them in that asbestos-roofed house with its aged walls. That memory of being forced into exile became their wound. Yet, the idea of return, the right to go home, was passed down through generations. The Nakba was a memory passed down from the elderly to the young. But in the war that Israel began waging on Gaza on October 7, 2023, we lived the Nakba. We were forcibly displaced under threat of weapons and air strikes. We saw our loved ones arrested before our eyes and tortured in prisons. We lived in tents and searched everywhere for basic provisions to save our children. My grandfather told me they fled under threat of weapons and planes – so did we. He said they searched for flour, food, and water while trying to protect their children – so are we, right now in the 21st century. Perhaps in 1948, the media was more primitive. But now, the world watches what’s happening in Gaza in many formats – written, visual, and audio – and yet, nothing has changed. Never did I imagine I’d live through an existential war – a war that threatens my very presence on my land, just as my grandparents lived through. The repeated scenes of displacement are so painful. They’re a cycle, one that we have been cursed to live through as Palestinians again and again. Will history record this as Nakba 2023? Years from now, will we speak of this Nakba just as we’ve spoken about the original one for 77 years? Will we tell stories, hold commemorations, and hold close memories of the dream of return that has stayed with us since childhood? Since I realised what it meant to be called a refugee and learned I had a homeland, I’ve been dreaming of returning. This pain, we can never forget it. I still remember the camp and my life there. I’ll never forget the moment Israel destroyed my house and made us homeless for two years, 24 years ago. Now we live our painful days searching for safety, fighting to survive. We will tell future generations about this war, the war of existence. We resist hunger, fear, thirst, and pain so we can remain on this land. The Nakba hasn’t ended. The 1948 Nakba continues in 2025.             Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/15/gaza-nakba-relived-2025"
"features","‘They’ll be back’: White Afrikaners leave South Africa to be refugees in US","15 May 2025","Qaanitah Hunter","Trump administration welcomes first batch of white Afrikaners while US cuts off refugee programmes to other countries. Johannesburg, South Africa – On a chilly Sunday evening in Johannesburg, OR Tambo International Airport was filled with tourists and travellers entering and exiting South Africa’s busiest airport. On one side of the international departures hall, a few dozen people queued – their trollies piled with luggage, travel pillows and children’s blankets – as they waited to board a charter flight to Washington Dulles International Airport in the United States. Dressed casually and comfortably for the 13-hour journey that would follow, the group – most young, all white – talked among themselves while avoiding onlookers. Although they blended into the bustling terminal around them, these weren’t ordinary travellers. They were Afrikaners leaving South Africa to be refugees in Donald Trump’s America. When Charl Kleinhaus first applied for refugee resettlement in the US earlier this year, he told officials he had been threatened and that people attempted to claim his property. The 46-year-old, who claimed to own a farm in Limpopo, South Africa’s northernmost province, was not required to present proof of these threats or provide details regarding when the alleged incidents occurred. On Sunday, he joined dozens of others accepted by the Trump administration as part of a pilot programme granting asylum to people from the Afrikaner community – descendants of mainly Dutch colonisers that led the brutal apartheid regime for nearly five decades. The Trump administration claims white people face discrimination in South Africa – a country where they make up some 7 percent of the population but own more than 70 percent of the land and occupy the majority of top management positions. “I want you all to know that you are really welcome here and that we respect what you have had to deal with these last few years,” US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau told Kleinhaus and the others when they landed at the Dulles International in Virginia. “We respect the long tradition of your people and what you have accomplished over the years,” he said on Monday. Speaking to a journalist at the airport, Kleinhaus said he never expected “this land expropriation thing to go so far” in South Africa. He was referring to the recently passed Expropriation Act, which allows the South African government to, in exceptional circumstances, take land for public use without compensation. Pretoria says the measure is aimed at redressing apartheid injustices, as Black South Africans who make up more than 80 percent of the population still own just 4 percent of the land. South African officials say the law has not resulted in any land grabs. There is also no record of Kleinhaus’s property being expropriated. Kleinhaus was unaffected by any threats and the government was unaware of anyone who might have threatened his property, Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told Al Jazeera. “The people of South Africa have not been affected by the expropriation of land. There’s no evidence. None of them are affected by any farm murders either,” the minister emphasised. In February, when Trump signed an executive order granting refugee status to Afrikaners, he cited widely discredited claims that their land was being seized and that they were being brutally killed in South Africa. On Monday, Trump again claimed that Afrikaners were victims of a “genocide” – an accusation South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and other experts maintain is based on lies. “Farmers are being killed,” Trump told reporters. “White farmers are being brutally killed, and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.” Ramaphosa has also debunked claims that the group who left this week faced any persecution at home. “They are leaving because they do not wish to embrace the democratic transformation unfolding in South Africa,” he said. For 60-year-old Sam Busa, watching Kleinhaus and the 48 other South Africans leave to be resettled in the US was a hopeful moment. Busa, who has also applied for asylum, is waiting in anticipation for an interview that would qualify her for resettlement. She has begun selling excess household items in anticipation of her new life in the US. The semi-retired businesswoman has been at the forefront of efforts – through a website called Amerikaners – encouraging Afrikaners to take an interest in the US offer to grant refugee status on the grounds that they face racial persecution in South Africa. When asked how she has experienced persecution because of her race, Busa recounted an incident where she was held at gunpoint at her home in Johannesburg – the commercial capital of South Africa and one of the most dangerous cities in the world. She later moved to KwaZulu-Natal on the country’s east coast, where she ran a business that provided services to the government. When asked whether she believed she was targeted because of her race or if she was simply a victim of common crime, Busa asserted it did not matter. She didn’t feel safe, she said. “I am not overly sensitive. When I watch Julius Malema singing about killing the Boer, it is extremely terrifying.” Malema, the far-left leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) political party, often sings a famous anti-apartheid song, Kill the Boer (Boer meaning farmer in Afrikaans), which the courts have ruled is not hate speech or an incitement to violence. For Busa, much like Kleinhaus, new legislation passed to bolster racial transformation, which includes having specific hiring targets for employment equity, has been “the straw that broke the camel’s back”. “Expropriation without compensation is a huge issue, along with the amendment to employment equity,” she said, restating her belief that white people don’t have a future in South Africa. “It’s coming hard and fast, and it’s becoming clear to [white] South Africans that we struggle with fears of home invasion. I don’t live on a farm, but there are massive fears because of the constant threat of crime. It has become clear to white South Africans; it’s not disguised,” she claimed. The narrative of fear is prevalent among those engaged in the refugee programme despite the fact that several experts have debunked the assertion that they were victims of racially motivated attacks and not common crime. South Africa sees about 19,000 murders a year. According to data from the police, most victims of rural crime are Black, with evidence showing that white farmers are not disproportionately being killed. Meanwhile, many participants in the US’s Afrikaner refugee resettlement programme do not even live on farms; many are urban dwellers, according to Minister Ntshavheni. Katia Beedan, who lives in Cape Town, is also anticipating resettlement in the US. She told Al Jazeera that refugee hopefuls do not have to prove racial persecution but simply articulate it. “For me, it’s racial persecution and political persecution,” she said about her reasons for wanting to leave South Africa. The copywriter-turned-life coach pointed to racial transformation laws targeting employment equity and land expropriation, which she believes the government is “overwhelming us with”, as a key reason for her desire to flee. However, many other South Africans see sections of the Afrikaner community – including their right-wing lobby groups like AfriForum that first pushed the false narrative of a “white genocide” – as struggling to exist equally in a country where they were once considered superior because of their race. “I think AfriForum is struggling with the reality of being ordinary,” social justice activist and South Africa’s former public protector, Thuli Madonsela, told local TV channel, Newzroom Afrika, in March. “The new South Africa requires all of us to be ordinary, whereas colonialism and apartheid made white people special people. “I think some white people … [are] seeking to reverse the wheel and find reason to be special again. They seem to have found an ally in the American president,” she said. In February, as Trump expedited efforts to resettle Afrikaners in the US, he was closing off his country’s refugee programme to other asylum seekers from war-torn and famine-stricken parts of the world. For Loren Landau from the African Centre for Migration and Society at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, the Afrikaner refugee relocation is “absurd and ridiculous”. “They have not been welcomed as tourists or work permit holders, but as refugees. The idea of a refugee system is to protect those who cannot be safeguarded by their own states and who fear persecution or violence because of who they are or their membership in a social group. Can Afrikaners make that case?” he asked. Although “there are people in South Africa who discriminate against them,” and Afrikaners now “have less privilege and protection than during the apartheid era”, it cannot be said that this is indicative of state policy, he said, adding that many different people are robbed, killed, and face discrimination in South Africa. “Are they [Afrikaners] specially victimised because of who they are? Absolutely not!” Landau added. He said all statistics on land ownership, income, and education levels indicate that South Africa’s white population far outstrips others: “They are still by far in the top strata of South African society. No one is taking their land. No one is taking their cars.” Even fringe groups that may have called for land grabs have done little to enact their threats, observers note. However, for Busa, that doesn’t matter. “I fear for my children. You never know when the EFF decides they want you dead. It’s not a country I want to live in,” she said. The EFF has said those who decide to leave South Africa should have their citizenship revoked. Confronted with the implications of this situation, the government is considering whether those who exit as refugees could easily return to the country. Ramaphosa is expected to discuss the ongoing matter with Trump at a meeting in the US next week. Meanwhile, for the Afrikaners now in the US, most will settle in Texas, with others in New York, Idaho, Iowa and North Carolina, while the government helps them find work and accommodation. They will hold refugee status for one year, after which they can apply for a US green card to make them permanent residents. At the same time, the Afrikaner resettlement programme remains open to others who want to apply. When Kleinhaus and his group arrived in the US on Monday, they had smiles on their faces as they met officials and waved US flags. Yet, for South Africa’s president, their resettlement in the US marks “a sad moment for them” – and something he believes may not last. “As South Africans, we are resilient. We don’t run away from our problems,” he said at an agricultural exhibition in Free State province on Monday. “If you look at all national groups in our country, Black and white, they’ve stayed in this country because it’s our country. “I can bet you that they [the Afrikaners who left] will be back soon because there is no country like South Africa.”             Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/15/theyll-be-back-white-afrikaners-leave-south-africa-to-be-refugees-in-us"
"features","Russia grabs a bit more of Ukraine as it heads into peace talks","15 May 2025","John T Psaropoulos","On eve of Istanbul peace talks, Moscow ignored a US-EU call for a 30-day ceasefire and showed signs of preparing for new offensives. Russian forces made creeping advances through Ukraine’s east this week, as the two countries prepared to hold their first direct talks in three years on Thursday. Russian forces captured the settlement of Kotlyarivka, southwest of the embattled area of Pokrovsk, on Monday, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said.     The seizure brought Russian forces to within 3.7km (2.3 miles) of the regional border between Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk in Ukraine. Russian forces also forced their way into the village of Myrolyubivka, east of Pokrovsk, and claimed to have taken the entire settlement. On Wednesday, Russia’s Defence Ministry claimed its forces took the community of Mykhailovka, also in Donetsk. These were minor advances, but showed there was no letup in Russia’s effort to take all of Donetsk and other regions it partly occupies, even as it prepared to go into peace talks. According to Ukrainian military intelligence, Russia was even moving troops into position for a major new offensive, the United Kingdom’s Financial Times reported. US President Donald Trump called for a 30-day ceasefire on May 8. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, flanked by the leaders of Poland, Germany, France and Britain, backed that demand on Saturday. Despite telling Western reporters Russia would “think about that”, the Kremlin ended up insisting on peace talks without a ceasefire, accusing Ukraine of violating previous ceasefires it announced unilaterally. Instead, Putin proposed peace talks without conditions at a dawn media conference on Sunday. “We are not ruling out that during these talks we will be able to agree on some new ceasefire, a new truce,” he said. Zelenskyy has said he would attend the talks in Istanbul if Putin does as well. Putin was expected after his spokesman said Russia would attend “at the corresponding” level, but then his name did not appear on a list of delegates Russia provided. “If Putin does not show up – if this is another game – it will clearly demonstrate that Russia is not ready to end the war,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media, calling for a new sanctions package in that case. As of Wednesday night, he was saying: “I am waiting to see who will come from Russia, and then I will decide which steps Ukraine should take.” US President Donald Trump, currently on a Middle East tour, is claiming credit for this diplomatic initiative. “I insisted that that meeting take place and it is taking place,” he said. Trump dispatched his Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and said he “was thinking of actually flying over. There’s a possibility of it, I guess, if I think things can happen.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will host the talks. “I think we have a window of opportunity this week and in the next 10 days – two weeks – to bring the issue of Ukraine to a more constructive level,” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told Turkiye’s Anadolu news agency. There appeared to be a connection between Putin’s meetings with foreign leaders on Saturday, and his peace talks proposal at dawn on Sunday. At 1:30am [22:30 GMT] on Sunday morning, he was still in talks with the leader of South Ossetia, a breakaway region of Georgia. It was the last of four days of meetings with 23 leaders who came to Moscow for the May 9 parade to celebrate the end of the second world war. At 4am [01:00 GMT], he alerted the media that he would announce “the results of international events to mark the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany”. When he invited Ukraine to peace talks in Turkiye less than two hours later, he also thanked foreign partners for their “peace-oriented efforts”, Kremlin newswire TASS reported. Zelenskyy said Ukraine had received a message of support for its call for a 30-day ceasefire from China, perhaps a sign that China privately put pressure on Putin to pursue peace. There were strong headwinds going into the talks, however. Putin’s language when announcing the talks was not friendly. “The ball is now in the court of the Kyiv government and its curators, who are guided by political ambitions – not their people’s interests – in their desire to continue the conflict with Russia with the hands of Ukrainian nationalists,” he said, a reference to European governments, which have been less keen than the Trump administration to push Ukraine into talks. Russia is taking a hard line going in. On Tuesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Russia would insist on the “denazification of the Kyiv regime”, Moscow’s way of describing Zelenskyy’s removal from office, and recognition of “current realities on the ground” – ie, there will be no territorial concessions. On Tuesday, almost on the eve of talks in Istanbul on Thursday, Putin was selling Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine to investors at the Delovaya Rossiya (Business Russia) association, implying there would be no territorial concessions. “There is something to invest in there. There are such lands, fertile in terms of agriculture and favourable in terms of tourism development,” he said. On Wednesday, Russian ambassador-at-large Rodion Miroshnik told reporters that negotiations need not go further than the Istanbul proposals of 2022. That was when Russia attempted to impose a capitulation agreement in March and April of 2022, when a Russian invasion force threatened to take Kyiv. It named Russia and China as Ukraine’s security guarantors, cut down Ukraine’s armed forces to 85,000 personnel, less than one-tenth of the current Ukrainian army, and forbade Ukraine from joining foreign alliances such as NATO. “Let’s go back, make adjustments to it that have emerged over the past three years and after that we will move to signing this document,” Miroshnik said. The Western position ahead of talks has also been hard on Russia. On the day of Putin’s parade, some 40 world leaders gathered in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv to celebrate the end of World War II and announced a tribunal to try Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The tribunal was to be launched in Luxembourg this week, when the Council of Europe was to convene. On Tuesday, the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization officially held Russia responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014. Pro-Russian separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine used a Russian Buk air defence system to down the plane in July that year, killing all 298 people on board. On Wednesday this week, the European Union agreed on a 17th sanctions package restricting 200 tankers used by Russia to evade a ban on its oil exports to the EU, bringing Moscow tens of billions in illicit dollars. EU foreign ministers are expected to put the sanctions into force on May 20. European commissioner for economic affairs Valdis Dombrovskis said work would begin immediately on an 18th package. On Monday, Poland shut down Russia’s consulate in Krakow, after investigators determined that a fire that destroyed the Marywilska shopping centre last year was the work of Russian saboteurs.

Long before lines were drawn on a map and city names were changed, there existed a land full of people who lived in bustling cities and remote villages, where markets overflowed with diverse voices, and farmers tended olive trees rooted deep in the hills. This story is told not through treaties or timelines, but through photographs: small, powerful fragments that capture the texture of daily life and those who lived it. They offer a rare, unfiltered lens into the lived reality of Palestinians in a time before exile and occupation dominated the narrative. This collection of 100 archived images of life in Palestine before the 1948 Nakba, when Zionist militias expelled at least 750,000 Palestinians and captured 78 percent of historical Palestine. Browse through Palestine as it was: people, places, and life and culture. The children, elders, farmers and merchants At the heart of any place is its people. This section gathers faces and figures of children, elders, farmers and merchants, capturing a moment in each of their lives. Traditional dress, expressions and gestures reflect a culture rich in diversity. Muslims, Christians, Jews, and Bedouins appear side by side, revealing a land defined not by division, but by coexistence. Each face carries its own story of life, labour, joy, or longing. Drag the slider or click on an image to see it in more detail.  Families, neighbours and friends gathered for the camera to record their moments together.  Streets, stones and sacred grounds. Palestine’s landscape is a tapestry of rolling hills, ancient olive groves, and vibrant cities, where history and nature intertwine. From the old stone quarters of Jerusalem to the hills of the Galilee, each image in this chapter grounds us in lived-in spaces carrying memory and meaning. From the bustling port of Jaffa to the stone alleys of Hebron, towns in Palestine bear layers of history.  Minarets, domes and arches stood as testaments to faith, craft and endurance.  Narrow alleys and open markets were arteries of daily life. Here, footsteps, voices, and trade converged in constant motion.  The rhythm of the everyday Here, we see how people moved, worked, gathered and celebrated. Carts on dusty roads, bread baking in clay ovens, weddings, markets and moments of rest. In kitchens and courtyards, daily rituals - grinding beans, sieving wheat and baking bread - played out with grace.  From weddings and blessings to public festivals and pilgrimages, communal life pulsed with joy and meaning, be it sharing lunch or walking in a bridal procession.  Work in olive groves, workshops and coastal waters was both a necessity and an art. These photographs honour the makers, menders, and growers who shaped Palestine through skill and perseverance.

"features","What does the PKK’s disarming mean for its regional allies?","14 May 2025","Justin Salhani","Syria’s SDF is unlikely to follow the PKK’s lead and disarm, but talks with Damascus could be bolstered. When Abdullah Ocalan said his Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, should lay down its arms and disband after more than four decades of conflict with the Turkish state and tens of thousands of deaths, there was an instant look across the border to Syria. Syria’s northeast is largely controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led military force Turkiye has repeatedly fought against over the past decade. The SDF is led by the People’s Protection Units (YPG), which Turkiye views as a “terrorist” group and the Syrian branch of the PKK. The United States, however, has backed the YPG in Syria to fight against ISIL (ISIS). Since the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, the SDF has been negotiating with the new Turkish-allied government in Damascus over what its future role in a newly unified Syria and as a military force will be and what kind of governance will extend to the northeast of the country. The removal of the PKK from the equation will likely facilitate the SDF’s integration with Damascus, analysts told Al Jazeera. “For the SDF, it makes it much easier to talk with the government in Damascus and also to de-escalate their relations with Turkey,” said Wladimir van Wilgenburg, an analyst of Kurdish politics based in Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq. While the SDF rejects Turkiye’s assertions that it is the Syrian arm of the PKK, analysts said the groups have strong links. While the PKK’s announcement that it would heed Ocalan’s call and disarm was welcomed by SDF leader Mazloum Abdi, he said his group would not disarm and Ocalan’s decision did not extend to Syria. But this could give the group further incentives to bring its fighting force and governing structure – called the Autonomous Administration in North and East Syria (AANES) – under the umbrella of the new government in Damascus. When reached for comment on Monday, an AANES spokesperson told Al Jazeera: “The autonomous administration is not concerned with the internal affairs of other countries.” The SDF has clashed with Turkish-backed Syrian factions, including in the immediate days after the fall of al-Assad’s regime, and sustained attacks from Turkiye’s air force. In December, the US negotiated a ceasefire between the SDF and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, which has since been incorporated into Syria’s new armed forces. Abdi has been in discussions with the new Syrian government, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, over how best to integrate the SDF into the post-Baathist Party security forces and govern Syria’s northeast.    The SDF has engaged in the talks with the pressure of an impending US troop withdrawal from northeast Syria. Without a US presence and support, the SDF has feared it might be vulnerable to attacks from Turkiye or Turkish-backed factions in Syria. But should the PKK’s decision to disarm bring a feeling of security to Turkiye along its border with Syria, analysts said the relations between the SDF and Turkiye would also likely improve. “We know that Turkey’s hardline stance towards the SDF was very much linked to concerns over the PKK and not so much about the SDF being Kurdish-dominated,” Thomas Pierret, a Syria specialist and senior researcher at the Institute of Research and Study on the Arab and Islamic Worlds, told Al Jazeera. This is evident by Turkiye’s relations with Masoud Barzani and his Kurdish Democratic Party in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region, Pierret said. Of course, this new reality “doesn’t mean it will be easy”, according to Pierret. Under the agreement between Turkiye and the PKK, some fighters could be relocated to third countries – essentially sent into exile. There’s also the possibility some fighters may decide to make their way to northeast Syria, in which case, Pierret said, Turkiye could see the SDF as a haven for PKK fighters. So Turkiye will keep a close eye on the SDF in Syria and the SDF’s negotiations with Damascus. In the past, the Turkish military has launched drones, fired artillery and carried out air strikes against Kurdish fighters, including the SDF.  And analysts said military options may still be on the table going forward. “For now, they seem to be letting negotiations take their course,” Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International with a focus on Syria, told Al Jazeera. “And that’s probably related both to events in Syria but also to the PKK process.”    The PKK’s affiliates and allies are spread across regions of the Middle East where Kurds live. Historically, the PKK has operated in Turkiye as well as northern Iraq. And their allies have operated in places where Kurds live in Syria and Iran. Their struggles have often opposed the national authorities in those places or sought self-determination or federalism. One example is the Kurdistan Free Life Party, or PJAK, in Iran, which says its goal is to declare an autonomous Kurdish region in Iran. “It’s unclear what will happen with the … PJAK because they also have a number of Iranian Kurdish fighters inside the PKK,” van Wildenburg said. “It’s possible that they will continue as a political party and not as an armed group because they are already not doing much fighting against the Iranian state anyway.” Analysts agree it is unclear whether the PKK’s allies will follow Ocalan’s lead and lay down their arms or, as is the case with the SDF in Syria, if they will view their own struggles as independent and make decisions on their own.

"features","Writing the wrongs","14 May 2025","Noel Ransome","Novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen weighs the costs of speaking against injustice In a theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen readied himself to speak. It was December 2023, and Nguyen was midway through a six-part lecture series at Harvard University. But the remarks he had originally drafted months earlier, during the summer, had begun to feel stale. Something more recent was weighing on his mind: Israel's war on Gaza. Since the war began that October, Nguyen had watched coverage showing Palestinian families erased overnight, neighbourhoods levelled to dust and starvation wielded as a weapon. But he had also felt the sting of public backlash for speaking out. Criticism of the war was often accompanied by accusations of anti-Semitism or indifference to the suffering of captives held in Gaza by the armed group Hamas. For artists like Nguyen, the consequences could be lost contracts and cancelled gigs. Nguyen had already seen his scheduled talk at New York’s 92nd Street Y — a major cultural institution in the United States — abruptly paused after he signed a letter denouncing the violence in Gaza. As he prepared to resume the podium at Harvard, he faced a choice: to confront what he saw as a present-day injustice — and accept the pushback — or avoid the subject entirely. He decided to do what he felt was uncomfortable, but necessary. ""It’s easy to talk about darkness in history,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""But are we willing to confront what’s happening right now, right in front of our faces, in Palestine?""  That lecture series became the basis for Nguyen's latest book, To Save and to Destroy, released in the US last month. In its pages, Nguyen — the winner of a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, one of the country's highest literary honours — lays out the argument that writers are never neutral. They are entangled in the very systems they seek to portray. Merging memoir, criticism and political reflection, it is a book preoccupied with power: who holds it, who resists it and what is at stake when artists dare to speak freely. Nguyen knows this terrain firsthand. After all, the currents of international power have shaped his life, starting from an early age. Born in 1971, in the midst of the Vietnam War, Nguyen was only four years old when the North Vietnamese forces made their final push to secure their grip on the country. Faced with soldiers sweeping south, Nguyen, his mother and his older brother fled their hometown of Buôn Ma Thuột by foot. On a boat to Saigon, they were reunited with Nguyen's father and began their journey to the US as refugees. Confronting the history and politics of that era has been a defining theme in his work. The Sympathizer — his Pulitzer-winning debut — explores the fractured identities and divided loyalties of a spy in the aftermath of the war. His nonfiction, including Nothing Ever Dies, offers a lens on how memories of wartime can be warped and manipulated. “War, memory, identity — that triangle made me American,” Nguyen told Al Jazeera. While some prize escapism in literature, Nguyen finds inspiration in confronting the thorniness of politics. His work has earned him several prestigious awards, ranging from the Guggenheim Fellowship to the MacArthur ""genius grant"". ""The idea that art is political isn’t a deformation of art. It’s a fulfilment of it,"" he said.  But the political climate surrounding the war in Gaza has presented new challenges for Nguyen and other writers. As far back as 2016, Nguyen had expressed support for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), a nonviolent protest movement against Israel to support Palestinian rights. In October 2023, he signed an open letter published in the London Review of Books, alongside more than 750 other writers, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and condemning Israel’s military actions. But the fallout was swift. The cancellation of his talk at the 92nd Street Y sparked national media attention and intense public debate. ""I hope there is a moral consensus that killing civilians is wrong, whether Hamas does it or whether Israel does it,"" he wrote in response on social media. Still, some commenters criticised him for claiming a ""moral equivalence"" between the two sides. Nguyen underscored that his platform is not a shield: He still faces backlash to his work. ""People simply don't talk to me any more, people have thrown me out of their circles, or I've lost invitations to things,"" he said. Still, he acknowledged that his standing in the literary community has helped make the ""price"" of his choices ""manageable"". ""I speak from a position of privilege,"" he said. ""My titles, my professional status — maybe they protect me a little."" Other writers, he added, are more vulnerable, and the consequences of speaking out can be more severe.  In May 2021, for instance, a 22-year-old Associated Press staffer, Emily Wilder, was fired after right-wing media resurfaced pro-Palestinian statements she made while in college. More recently, in March, the administration of President Donald Trump detained Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student studying at Tufts University, and stripped her of her visa. Her supporters say she did little more than co-write an op-ed critical of the university's refusal to ""acknowledge the Palestinian genocide"". Though she has been released from government custody, she continues to face deportation proceedings. One culture writer and critic, speaking to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, explained that he fears that speaking out on issues like the war in Gaza could jeopardise his work visa status in the US. In addition to his work as a writer, he has a background in film and television, having taken on roles as a director, screenwriter and editor for several international projects. ""In the last couple of months, I’ve felt this overwhelming guilt, like I’m choosing my own safety over speaking out. It’s the first time I’ve really felt that way,"" he said. ""I’ve done a couple of on-camera interviews for the BBC, where I wore a Palestinian keffiyeh and was very outspoken. But I don’t see myself doing that in the near future."" He added that he has friends with green cards who were unexpectedly interrogated upon re-entering the US, despite their status as permanent residents. ""After Trump’s re-election, I told myself, 'This time, I’m not going to stay angry and frustrated. I’m just going to put my head down and keep moving forward,'"" he said. Celine Parreñas Shimizu, the dean of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, believes voices like Nguyen's can help break the silence that results from such crackdowns and threats. ""Critical acclaim"", she explained, ""enables creativity in response to the forces that seek to silence us"". But she, too, warned that no amount of accolades could fully protect an author from damage to their reputation or lost opportunities. ""Critical or professional acclaim offers no true shield against racism's fundamental dehumanisation,"" Parreñas Shimizu said.  The pressures on young, emerging writers weigh heavily on Nguyen, who has witnessed similar struggles among his students at the University of Southern California. ""Young writers here, they’re like writers everywhere. They’re afraid of not getting published. They’re afraid of not having a life in the audience,"" Nguyen said. Those fears can lead to life-altering decisions, Nguyen explained. ""I’ve had a writer who is trans. They left the US a few weeks ago, terrified, and removed themselves to another country."" When he talks to his students, he emphasises the time and difficulty involved in pursuing a career in writing, no matter the circumstances. ""What I try to do with those writers is impress upon them that it took 30 years of misery to get to where I am. Every writer is alone. You have to cultivate discipline within yourself to confront that solitude."" But even so, those closest to Nguyen wonder about the toll his writing and public activism can take. Thi Bui, a cartoonist, first bonded with Nguyen during a writers' residency run by the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network (DVAN). They have collaborated on a children's book in the years since. Bui told Al Jazeera that she admires the way Nguyen takes on each of his roles — writer, activist, father — with equal strength. ""He takes things head-on,"" she said. ""He channels his anger into writing fast."" But she has also noticed the pressure he faces for speaking out, even at times when silence might be easier. ""He’s always carrying more than he lets on,"" Bui said. ""Even when he’s joking or smiling, you can feel the heaviness behind it. I sometimes worry about that. As much as he works on the world, there’s always a lot of trauma he’s had to grapple with."" But for Nguyen, speaking out is part of his cultural framework — an inextricable part of himself. ""I grew up Catholic. Pope Francis just died, and I’ve been thinking about him,"" he said. ""That tradition taught me about justice — not as a slogan, but something spiritual. Jesus was a truth-teller. That mattered."" His writing, he says, is tied to that spiritual inheritance. ""I carry that obligation with me.""

"features","In some Jewish families, speaking up for Palestine stirs discontent","14 May 2025","Anealla Safdar","Opposing views have become more entrenched since the genocide in Gaza began, resulting in disownment for some. On a cold December day during the Christmas holidays, Dalia Sarig’s 80-year-old father arrived at her home in Vienna after she had returned from a skiing trip. He was there to pick up her stepsister, who had joined Sarig’s family on vacation. She was convinced it would be her last meeting with her father, as their political differences were about to come to a head. “I said goodbye. I hugged him,” she told Al Jazeera. “When I said goodbye, I said goodbye knowing that maybe I will not see him any more.” Tensions with her Jewish family had been building for years. At 56, Sarig, a pro-Palestine activist, is at odds with most of her relatives. Her parents adhere to Zionism, the nationalist political ideology that called for the creation of a Jewish state and is seen by Palestinians and their supporters as the system that underpins their suffering. Sarig knew during that December meeting with her father that she intended to stage a pro-Palestine demonstration outside parliament in January that would be filmed by a local television station. The activist group she was a part of had put her forward for a broadcast interview. Appalled by Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and determined to speak up, she went ahead with it. “The interview was broadcast and it immediately went to my family.” She later heard that her father, who also lives in the Austrian capital, had told friends that “to him, I died”. “But he never talked about it with me, he never reached out to me to tell me something like this. [He] just cut the relation.” Her 77-year-old mother, who lives in Germany, messaged her a week later. “I still have it here in my phone, saying, you know, ‘I will not accept your political activism. You’re a traitor, you are dirtying the nest … and should you change your political views, we can return to normal. Stay healthy.’” She has not spoken with her parents since. Family divides are not uncommon among Jewish families from the United States to Israel, but have become more entrenched since October 7, 2023. On that day, Hamas, the group that governs the Gaza Strip, led an incursion into southern Israel during which 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive. Since then, Israeli bombardments have killed more than 61,700 people in the enclave. “I think one of the most interesting phenomena among the liberal Zionists is the fact, while the majority moved to the right because of October 7, a minority became even more disenchanted with Israel and Zionism,” the author and academic Ilan Pappe, a prominent critic of Zionism, told Al Jazeera. Sarig’s ancestors fled Austria in 1938, the year of annexation by Nazi Germany, for Serbia. They later settled in Palestine under the British Mandate in what is now present-day Israel. But by the 1950s, most of her relatives had returned to Austria, where she was born. As a child, she celebrated Jewish holidays while learning about Zionism from elders. She was also told that Palestinians “are the enemies, they want to kill all the Jews … that the Jews living there [in Israel] wanted peace, but the Arabs did not”. At 18, she moved to Israel, where, at her parents’ encouragement, she joined a leftist Zionist youth movement. Over 13 years in Israel, she joined a kibbutz, served in the Israeli army in an office role, and married. But it was as she studied politics and Middle East history at Haifa University that her worldview began to change. That’s where she met a Palestinian professor and later became an activist for Palestinian rights. “It began on a lawn in an evening together with my Palestinian teacher, when he told me the story of his family that was displaced from a small village. “I understood that what I have been told, the Zionist narrative, is wrong,” she said. “I started to think how he might feel, how he’s feeling, or how I might feel as a Palestinian living in a Jewish state where my ancestors were expelled.” Back in Austria, her family would argue with her at gatherings, agree never to speak again on Palestine and Israeli politics, break their promises, and clash once again. In 2015, she renounced her Israeli citizenship as a gesture against Zionism. “It makes my activism easier,” Sarig said, on being disowned by some of her family. “I lost my Jewish community because I was considered at best, strange and weird, and at worst, a traitor.” But being cut off from one’s family can take a toll on mental health, say experts. According to Faissal Sharif, a neuroscientist and doctoral student at the University of Oxford, brain imaging studies have shown that “the experience of social isolation triggers activity in areas that would otherwise light up in response to physical pain”. “In other words, social pain is not metaphorical – it is biologically real,” he told Al Jazeera. Families, he said, often form “microcultures” with their own rules and positions on political issues. “The betrayal felt when love and acceptance are made conditional upon silence or complicity in the genocide can be deeply wounding. In the context of Gaza, it adds an additional layer of trauma: not only is one bearing witness to mass suffering, but also paying a personal price for refusing to look away,” he said. “This leads to long-lasting stress and anxiety, which can reach clinical levels.” To preserve relationships, he said families need to lead with “curiosity, not confrontation”. “Especially when the topic is something as painful as war or genocide, facts alone won’t move people – naming the emotions underneath, like fear, guilt, or grief, often opens more space for real dialogue.” Having such conversations isn’t easy. Jonathan Ofir, a musician who was born in an Israeli kibbutz and emigrated to Denmark in the late 1990s, said that it was in 2009 that he realised he had “actually been indoctrinated into a propaganda that omitted a whole Palestinian viewpoint”. He read Pappe’s book, The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, describing that experience as a “turning point” for him. Around the same time, he read other Jewish and Palestinian writers who “challenged the Zionist narrative”. “[But] I didn’t share this publicly and I didn’t share it with my family either.” In 2014, though, during Israel’s war on Gaza – the third within seven years – he said he felt confident enough to express his critical views “outwards and publicly”. More than 2,000 Palestinians – including 551 children – were killed during the 50-day conflict. He took to Facebook to post an image of Israelis gathered on a hilltop near Sderot watching on as Gaza burned, a photograph that was featured in The New York Times. A relative soon wrote him an email that concluded by recommending that Ofir “stop posting on the internet”. “It became this heated debate, but it very, very quickly stopped.” Years later, he learned that his family in Israel had decided to avoid talking about politics around him “so as to not legitimise my political views”, he said. After the October 7 attack, he checked on his extended family who lived near the site of the assault. But the incursion did not alter his position. “My outlook hasn’t significantly changed. But something changed in the Israeli society. And in that sense, you could say we might be more distant politically.” Netherlands-based Daniel Friedman, 44, was raised in South Africa by his father, Steven, an academic and vocal critic of Zionism, and his mother, who was part of a circle of anti-Apartheid activists. While his father remains an anti-Zionist, Friedman said that he and his mother have increasingly been clashing over Israel’s genocide in Gaza since late 2023. “This is really the only issue nowadays” affecting the conversations and bonds within some Jewish communities, he said. One of their earlier arguments regarded the debunked claims that Palestinian fighters raped women during the October 7 incursion. After several uneasy disputes, often battled out by ping-ponging various newspaper links to support their arguments on WhatsApp, they have agreed to stop talking about politics. “I love her, but what I struggle with is that I’ve lost a lot of trust for her,” said Friedman. During a previous Israeli war on Gaza, his mother had signed a petition calling for a ceasefire, a move which saw her rejected by some family members. “I think that had quite a big effect,” he said. “She kind of went to the right.” He said that he understands that for some, taking a stand means risking losing the support of a close community. He, however, chose to “cut a lot of people out of my life on purpose” after October 7, he said. Back in Vienna, Sarig is busy organising a conference of Jewish anti-Zionists in June, featuring speakers such as Stephen Kapos, a UK-based Holocaust survivor, the American podcaster and commentator Katie Halper and Ronnie Barkan, a Jewish Israeli activist. Pappe too is expected to attend. As the killings in Gaza continue, her focus, she said, is on the Palestinians trying to survive Israeli fire. “I’m not the victim,” Sarig said.

"features","‘We need our bananas back’: Traders left in limbo amid Malawi-Tanzania spat","14 May 2025","Charles Pensulo","A trade dispute between the southeast African neighbours left Malawian fruit sellers struggling for produce and income. Lilongwe, Malawi – Since he was young, Enock Dayton has made a living from bananas. The 30-year-old was born and raised in Molele, in the southern Malawian district of Thyolo, which was at the heart of local banana production until a plant virus devastated crops more than a decade ago. At his stall at Mchesi market, in Malawi’s capital Lilongwe, Dayton serves customers from the bunches of green bananas that he has. “I started this business when I was young, and we had farms where we were growing bananas and we would take trucks and bring them here and sell them to individuals,” he told Al Jazeera. But in 2013, the deadly banana bunchy top disease wiped out almost all the crops in the country. Farmers were asked to uproot their banana plants to avoid the spread of the virus; hundreds of thousands of people were affected. Bananas are Malawi’s fourth biggest staple crop, after maize, rice and cassava, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The United Nations body – which is working with other organisations to help revive banana farming in the country – said in 2023 that with “the right investments and strategic support, the banana sector has the potential to provide greater benefits in food and nutrition security and commercial value for growers, transporters, consumers and food processors”. But in the meantime, to maintain their businesses in the absence of sufficient local produce, farmers and fruit-sellers like Dayton turned to neighbouring Tanzania to import the crop and complement their own meagre local supplies. In 2023 alone, for instance, Malawi imported more than $491,000 worth of bananas, with the majority of that – 5,564,180kg (12,266,920lb) – coming primarily from Tanzania. The remainder came from South Africa and Mozambique. But this year, that arrangement came to a sudden halt. In March, Malawi said it was temporarily banning the import of some farm produce, including bananas, from Tanzania and other countries. The government said this was to help support local industries and stabilise the country’s foreign exchange shortage, which has led to challenges that include the inability to import some necessities, like pharmaceuticals. But Malawi might have underestimated the effect of its bold move, observers say. In retaliation, in April, Tanzania banned the entry of all agricultural imports from Malawi, responding to what it described as restrictions on some of its exports. That ban also extended to South Africa, which for years prohibited the entry of bananas from Tanzania. This was bad news for Malawi, observers say, as it is more on the receiving end of trade between the neighbours. According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), Malawi exports less than $50m worth of products to Tanzania, including soybean meal, soybeans and dried legumes, while it imports hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of mineral fuels, oil, distilled products, soaps, lubricants, cement and glassware, among other products. In its response, Dar es Salaam went a step further, extending its trade ban to the export of fertiliser from Tanzania to landlocked Malawi. It also threatened to stop goods en route to Malawi from passing through Tanzania. By land, Malawi depends on Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique for the import of goods. As it lacks direct access to the sea, Malawi utilises seaports in Tanzania and Mozambique. But the instability of the Mozambique route – due to insecurity caused by conflict, recent post-election violence and truck drivers facing harassment – made the deadlock with Tanzania a bigger challenge for industry. Businesses that rely on the import of farm produce started crying foul as their trucks of groundnuts and other produce stood in line at the Songwe border. Malawi also found itself in a tricky situation as it depends on Tanzania for its harbours to import fuel. Soon, even Kenya found itself entangled in the conflict as cargo from Malawi, which has to travel through Tanzania, was also stopped en route. The ensuing row shone a light on Malawi’s precarious geographical location, as well as regional agreements aimed at facilitating trade, the efforts by individual nations to follow the rules, and the macroeconomic imbalances in a nation designated as one of the poorest in the world. After weeks of tensions, this month, a high-level meeting between Malawi and Tanzania appeared to have brokered the differences, paving the way for the lifting of the bans between the two countries, according to a spokesperson for Malawi’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. For Ernest Thindwa, a political commentator based at the University of Malawi, the recent trade dispute does not exist in isolation – and should also be viewed from a political lens. Both countries are heading for polls this year, first Malawi in September and then Tanzania in November. Within an election environment, the dispute says something about the attempts by both countries’ leaders to display patriotism and a sense of empowerment to their citizens, the analyst said. “The current administration [in Malawi] wants to be seen to be delivering and they want to be seen to be responding to people’s concerns,” Thindwa told Al Jazeera. “And certainly they need to make sure that local producers are protected, which has become more urgent as we go towards elections.” Thindwa said that both Malawi and Tanzania are signatories to regional and international trade agreements, the frameworks of which entitle them to take measures to protect their trade interests when they deem necessary. However, he questioned the timing of these moves, asking why the initiatives by Malawi were not implemented earlier if they were indeed to protect local industries. Answering his own question, he said, “Because then it might have not been an agent in terms of attracting votes.” “What you would call subsistence or smallholder producers … would be significant for the government in terms of trying to win votes from such social groups,” he observed. Meanwhile, in Tanzania, something similar was at play in its decision to retaliate, Thindwa said. “The incumbent administration in Tanzania wants to be seen to be responding to the needs and interests of its citizens. So the administration in that country, in Tanzania, also wanted to project an image that it cares for its people. That’s why it responded rather quickly.” Broadly speaking, Thindwa noted that the trade dispute points to overall challenges African countries face – in terms of promoting internal trade, and trading more within Africa than with other continents. Citing the example of Angola, he said that despite it having oil, countries within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) bloc continue to import oil from the Middle East. “There is Angola there,” he said. “Why can’t they put together a regional project, for instance, and invest in the capabilities to make sure that the end product is being produced in Angola and Angola serves the region, to be much cheaper for the region? And it will make sure that the resources of the region remain within the region.” Such examples show that “in spite of these trade protocols, Africa still struggles to encourage trade between member states”, he said. “So the case of Tanzania and Malawi is just a symptom of a huge challenge Africa faces in terms of promoting internal trade.” In a statement on May 9, Malawi’s Ministry of Trade said Malawi and Tanzania had held bilateral discussions in Tanzania regarding the implementation and resolution of its prohibition order. After that, a letter from the ministry, addressed to Malawi’s Revenue Authority, read: “In this regard, I wish to advise that you facilitate the clearance of exports and imports of goods between the Republic of Malawi and the Republic of Tanzania. This, however, does not exempt importers from complying with legal and regulatory requirements, including obtaining the relevant licences and certifications from regulatory bodies.” After the talks, Charles Nkhalamba, Malawi’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, told Al Jazeera the neighbours had signed “a joint communique” to resolve the dispute between them. The “high-level discussions” were a result of “robust diplomatic efforts” by the foreign ministries of both countries, he said in a message on WhatsApp, adding that Tanzania also “acknowledg[ed] the economic circumstances that necessitated the import restrictions”. During the meeting, both parties agreed in principle on the importance of continuous engagement and communication on all matters impacting their bilateral trade relations, Nkhalamba added. Weeks earlier, Tanzania’s Ministry of Agriculture also released a statement acknowledging that Lilongwe had reached out to Dar es Salaam to resolve the problem and stating that “Tanzania is lifting a ban on export and import of agricultural produce to and from Malawi”. In principle, the trade war between the neighbours appears to have stalled for now. But experts told Al Jazeera that practically speaking, it will take time for the logistics to be sorted out and for things to return to normal for sellers left in limbo when their supplies dried up. At the market in Lilongwe, Dayton is eagerly awaiting the trucks of sweet bananas from across the border, so he has enough to sell to his customers. He is grateful for the cross-border trade, and the arrangement that has over the years helped business people like him make money selling the crop from their neighbours. But he also had mixed feelings as he reminisced about their lost opportunity to grow their own crops. “The amount of money we used to have when we grew our own bananas is different from what we’re earning now,” Dayton said. “While we were growing and buying them at a cheap price … we were making a lot of money, apart from the transport [costs]. The ones from Tanzania are quite expensive. “We need our bananas back.” A decade ago, Dayton was a casualty of a natural disaster that made his garden back in the village dormant. Now, he feels that he is a casualty of the decisions made by authorities in offices far away. “What we want is a stable supply of bananas in this market,” he said. “It’s good because it provides for our families and the customers as well.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/14/we-need-our-bananas-back-traders-left-in-limbo-amid-malawi-tanzania-spat"
"features","Kurdish leader Ocalan told the PKK to disband, it did: Here’s what to know","13 May 2025","Mat Nashed","PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is leading peace efforts to end a Kurdish armed rebellion against Turkiye after four decades. The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) says it is disbanding after more than 40 years of armed struggle against the Turkish state. The announcement came after the PKK held its congress in northern Iraq on Friday, about two months after its imprisoned founder, Abdullah Ocalan, also known as “Appo”, called on the group to disarm in February. For most of its history, the PKK has been labelled a terrorist group by Turkiye, the European Union and the United States. It fought for Kurdish autonomy for years, a fight that has been declared over now. This is all you need to know about why Ocalan and the PKK have given up their armed struggle. Ocalan was born to a poor Kurdish farming family on April 4, 1948, in Omerli, Sanliurfa, a Kurdish-majority part of Turkiye. He moved to Ankara to study political science at the university there, where he became politically active; driven, biographers say, by the sense of marginalisation that many Kurds in Turkiye felt. By the mid-1970s, he was advocating for Kurdish nationalism and went on to found the PKK in 1978. Six years later, the group launched a separatist rebellion against Turkiye under his command.    Ocalan had absolute rule over the PKK and worked to stamp out rival Kurdish groups, monopolising the struggle for Kurdish liberation, according to Blood and Belief: The PKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence, by Aliza Marcus. At the time, Kurds were denied the right to speak their language, give their children Kurdish names or show any expression of nationalism. Despite Ocalan’s authoritarian rule, his charisma and positioning as a champion of Kurdish rights led most Kurds across Turkiye to love and respect him, calling him “Appo”, which means Uncle. Violent. More than 40,000 people died between 1984 and 2024, with thousands of Kurds fleeing the violence in southeastern Turkiye into cities further north. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, Ocalan led operations from neighbouring Syria, which was a source of tensions between the then-Assad regime and Turkiye. The PKK resorted to brutal tactics beginning in the late 1980s and early 90s. According to a report by the European Council on Foreign Relations from 2007, the group, under Ocalan, kidnapped foreign tourists, adopted suicide bombing operations and attacked Turkish diplomatic offices in Europe. Perhaps even worse, the PKK would repress Kurdish civilians who did not assist the group in its guerrilla warfare. Eventually, more than a decade after he was caught. In 1998, Ocalan was forced to flee Syria due to the threat of a Turkish incursion to capture him. A year later, Turkish agents arrested him on a plane in Nairobi, Kenya, thanks to intel received from the US. He was brought back to Turkiye and handed the death penalty, yet his sentence was changed to life in prison after Turkiye abolished capital punishment in 2004 in a bid to become a member of the EU. By 2013, Ocalan changed his stance on separatism and began lobbying for comprehensive Kurdish rights and greater regional autonomy in Turkiye, saying he no longer believed in the effectiveness of armed rebellion. This radical shift led to the start of a shaky peace process between the PKK and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party), headed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The peace process led to some freedoms for Kurds, yet fighting erupted between the government and the PKK in 2015 due in part to fears that the party was trying to create a Kurdish statelet in neighbouring Syria during its civil war. At the time, many Kurds from southern Turkiye had left for Syria to help the Kurds there fight against ISIL (ISIS). In 2015, the AK Party had also formed a new alliance with the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which was staunchly opposed to any peace process involving the PKK.    In announcing its disarmament, the PKK said it has “completed its historical mission” by “breaking the policy of denial and annihilation of our people and bringing the Kurdish issue to a point where solving it can occur through democratic politics”. However, analysts argue that there are other reasons behind the decision. The PKK and its Kurdish allies in the region are more vulnerable than before due to recent developments, according to Sinan Ulgen, an expert on Turkiye and senior fellow at Carnegie Europe in Brussels. “The reason the PKK gave up its armed struggle has to do with the change in the international context,” Ulgen explained. US President Donald Trump does not see Syria as a “strategic focal point” for foreign policy and is, therefore, unlikely to keep supporting Kurdish armed groups in the country as it had during the fight against ISIL, he explained. In addition, the new government in Syria is on good terms with Turkiye, unlike under the now-overthrown Assad regime. This new relationship could significantly hurt the ability of the PKK and its Syrian offshoot, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), to operate along the Syria-Turkiye border. The political climate seems ripe for that. Main political parties, such as the AK Party and its rival Republican People’s Party (CHP), have vocally or tacitly supported a new peace process. But it was the MHP, long opposed to any overtures to the Kurds, that created the window for a new peace process. In April 2024, MHP leader Devlet Bahceli invited Ocalan to renounce “terrorism” in front of Turkiye’s parliament in exchange for possible parole. “The fact it was Bahceli … was kind of unbelievable,” said Sinem Adar, an expert on Turkiye with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWB). Bahceli’s change of heart is probably to help his coalition partner, Erdogan, run in and win the next national election, experts told Al Jazeera. Under the constitution, Erdogan cannot run for another term unless an early election is called, which needs 360 out of 600 votes in parliament. To add the votes of Kurdish delegates from the Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) to the MHP-AK Party alliance’s votes, “[Erdogan] needs to broaden his political support base in parliament over and above the current ruling alliance”, Carnegie’s Ulgen told Al Jazeera. It is unclear if he will be released, but his prison conditions could significantly improve, said Ulgen. He said the government would prefer to gradually increase Ocalan’s freedoms, so it can gauge the reactions of his support base and the broader public. Many people in Turkiye still view Ocalan as a “terrorist” and blame him for a conflict that has taken the lives of so many. “I think the government wants to test the waters before allowing Ocalan to go free,” Ulgen told Al Jazeera.

"features","Drones, gold, and threats: Sudan’s war raises regional tensions","13 May 2025","Mat Nashed","RSF drone strikes on Port Sudan have raised regional tensions and put a spotlight on the country’s booming gold economy. On May 4, Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a barrage of suicide drones at Port Sudan, the army’s de facto wartime capital on the Red Sea. The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) accused foreign actors of supporting the RSF’s attacks and even threatened to sever ties with one of its biggest trading partners. The RSF surprised many with the strikes. It had used drones before, but never hit targets as far away as Port Sudan, which used to be a haven, until last week. “The strikes … led to a huge displacement from the city. Many people left Port Sudan,” Aza Aera, a local relief worker, told Al Jazeera. “If the aggression continues … I think I’ll leave like everyone else.” When a civil war erupted between the SAF and RSF in April 2023, the army had aerial supremacy due to its fleet of warplanes and drones. Yet the RSF is closing the gap with an arsenal of suicide drones, which it used on Port Sudan for six consecutive days, hitting an army base, a civilian airport, several hotels, and a fuel depot, which caused a massive blast. “Sudan had already entered the phase of drone warfare over the last … few months at least,” said Suliman Baldo, the founder of the Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker think tank.    The army largely relies on the relatively affordable Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones, reportedly receiving $120m worth of them since late 2023. Bayraktars can travel long distances with a large payload, and the army says they helped it regain swaths of territory from the RSF in eastern and central Sudan between September 2024 and March 2025, including the capital Khartoum. Despite losing significant ground, the RSF then stepped up its aggression against the SAF with Chinese-made drones, according to a recent report by Amnesty International. The human rights group, Sudan’s de facto military government and other monitors all accuse the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of purchasing these drones – and other weapons – and supplying them to the RSF. The UAE has denied the accusations as “baseless”. “The UAE strongly rejects the suggestion that it is supplying weapons to any party involved in the ongoing conflict in Sudan,” said Salem Aljaberi, a spokesperson for the UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement on X. Regardless, the increasing use of drones by both sides marks an escalation and risks exacerbating an already catastrophic situation for civilians, according to experts and human rights monitors. On May 6, the army-backed authorities in Port Sudan announced the severing of all ties with the UAE after accusing it of being behind the attacks. That announcement was not well thought-out, according to Baldo. Sudan’s army could lose tens of millions of dollars in gold revenue, as well as access to vital banking operations, he told Al Jazeera. A UAE-backed company, Emiral Resources, owns a majority of shares in Sudan’s largest gold mine, the Kush mine. Kush is administered by Sudan’s army, which likely sells tens of millions of dollars worth of gold to the UAE. According to the Central Bank of Sudan, about 97 percent of gold exports from army-controlled areas went to the UAE in 2023. Kush exported at least one tonne of gold in 2024, although it is unclear how much higher the number is for production. Furthermore, UAE banks own a majority share in the Bank of Khartoum, whose digital platform, Bankak, facilitates money transfers for millions of displaced Sudanese and public institutions. Sudan’s state-owned El Nilein Bank also has a branch in the UAE that plays a critical role in approving international transfers on behalf of the army-backed authorities in Port Sudan, according to a report that Baldo co-authored in March for the Chatham House think tank. “This was a rushed decision [to cut ties with the UAE] that will have serious consequences … due to the UAE’s control over [Sudan’s] national economy,” Baldo told Al Jazeera. Sudan’s army has not clarified how and when it will sever ties with the UAE.    On May 6, SAF chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan vowed in a video to “defeat the militia (RSF) and those who help them”. Al Jazeera sent written questions to army spokesperson Nabil Abdullah, asking if Port Sudan will implement the announced suspension. No reply was received by time of publication. For its part, the UAE’s Foreign Ministry told Al Jazeera in an email that it will not retaliate against Port Sudan. “The statement issued by the so-called ‘Security and Defence Council’ will not affect the deep-rooted and enduring ties between the UAE and the Republic of the Sudan, and their peoples,” the emailed statement said. Meanwhile, experts and observers believe the war in Sudan is trending towards a major escalation. The army’s regional backers could respond to the RSF’s increased use of drones by doubling down on their support for the army, warned Alan Boswell, a Sudan expert for the International Crisis Group. “The obvious risk [from the attacks on Port Sudan] is that it brings other [regional powers] into deeper involvement on the army’s side,” he told Al Jazeera. “We could see an escalating war with greater and greater firepower, and nothing would be left of Sudan’s infrastructure by the end of it.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/13/drones-gold-and-threats-sudans-war-raises-regional-tension"

"features","Resistance and extractivism: Inside Carrara, home of white marble","11 May 2025","Chiara Braucher","In a place where natural beauty and industrial extraction collide, people are fighting for an Italian town threatened by decline. Carrara, Italy - At dawn, the jagged peaks of the Apuan Alps can be seen rising steeply above the Tyrrhenian Sea, their sharp silhouettes mirrored in the still water below. Shaped over millennia by wind and rain - and in recent centuries by mining - these mountains have a deeply scarred appearance. For more than 2,000 years, marble has been extracted from these hills. But today, the damage this has caused is more visible than ever. Aquifers polluted by industrial products used for the mining process, a near-constant procession of heavy trucks pumping fumes into the air and a high number of workplace accidents in the quarries - the last fatal accident happened on April 28 - are the daily reality of a territory in flux, a place where natural beauty and industrial transformation collide. Carrara, a small town nestled at the foot of the Apuan Alps in northwestern Tuscany, is one of the world’s most important white marble extraction districts, with more than 100 quarries on its doorstep. Marble has been quarried in this area since Roman times, when it became the stone of the empire. Used for decoration, construction and sculpture, it was a symbol of prestige and high status. Later, it was used by the Catholic Church in much the same way - to adorn important palaces and cathedrals and to create religious sculptures. During the Renaissance, Carrara marble gained fame through sculptures by artists like Michelangelo, Donatello, Bernini and others.  Over the past two centuries, however, the process has changed dramatically - shifting from artisanal methods to industrial extraction. Today, marble still carries the aura of global luxury. It’s celebrated in architecture magazines, interior design trends, and films like The Brutalist. But beneath the polished surface lies a far more complex story. Over the past 30 years, more marble has been extracted than during the previous two millennia. From the port of Marina di Carrara, a few kilometres from the quarries, it is shipped across the globe. According to municipal data, Carrara’s marble industry produces between 4 million and 5 million tonnes of marble each year, generating 130 million euros ($148m) in profits, driven largely by exports: Raw blocks go mainly to China (51 percent), while carved marble items head mostly to the United States, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The historical centre of Carrara is a maze of narrow, medieval streets lined with pastel-coloured facades, artisan workshops and quiet courtyards. The Carrione stream, which flows down from the Apuan Alps, cuts through the downtown area where 14th- to 18th-century stone houses with shuttered windows stand alongside ornate church portals and marble sculptures - carved from stone extracted just a few kilometres away in the mountains that are clearly visible from the city.  Since the 2012 opening of the Strada dei Marmi - a 119-million euro ($135m) bypass stretching 6km (4 miles) between the quarries and the local industrial area, diverting heavy traffic away from the town - marble trucks no longer barrel through the town centre. At one point, as many as 600 trucks each day brought dust, noise and diesel fumes into town. Today, the air is cleaner, the streets are calmer. But the silence also reflects a broader decline. Carrara’s population has fallen below 60,000 - its lowest since World War II - and more than 200 small businesses have shut down in the past 10 years. As young people have left in search of work elsewhere and automation has replaced many jobs in the quarries, the bakeries, butchers, fishmongers - everyday life in the town - are disappearing. The quarries are also changing. Today, less than 1 percent of the marble extracted in Carrara is used for sculpture - a stark departure from the region’s traditional legacy. That included the romanticised myth around the men who worked in the quarries. For centuries, men extracted marble from the rugged Apuan Alps with limited means, facing immense risks and frequent accidents. They were seen by Italians as conquering the mountains through grit and sheer determination and were considered a symbol of strength and sacrifice. The marble mined was used primarily for the construction and decoration of temples, public monuments, churches, palaces and fine sculpture, as well as locally for furnishing homes. Only scraps and lower-grade stone were diverted for use as lime or aggregate for construction.  These days, much of the marble mined here is turned into calcium carbonate, a key ingredient used to make everyday products including toothpaste, paper and paint. Since the 1980s, the calcium carbonate market has made it possible to transform waste - marble blocks not suitable for other uses - into profit by grinding it into marble powder for use in various industrial goods. Meanwhile, large marble blocks are shipped abroad, where cheaper labour is used to produce tiles, furniture and luxury finishes. Carrara, once the beating heart of marble craftsmanship, therefore, has lost nearly all of its artisanal industry. “Carrara has changed,” says Matteo Procuranti, an artist and activist whose father was once a quarry director. “Back in the day, we had three cinemas and two theatres,” recalls the former quarry worker. “Now it’s all closed. People leave. Carrara has become a dormitory beneath the quarries.” Matteo’s father, like many others, switched from extracting marble blocks to working for Omya, a multinational company that, starting in the 1980s, began grinding marble waste into calcium carbonate. Eventually, he was laid off during a round of job cuts. That experience triggered a deep awakening for Matteo, gradually changing his life and perspective. “It wasn’t just about the quarries,” he says. “Over time, I realised the problem was much bigger - it had to do with the entire economic and production model.” He believes the region has been overtaken by what he calls “extractivism”, a system driven by profits. “It consumes resources, drains communities, and concentrates power and wealth elsewhere,” he says. “It has become a political struggle [for us], a collective one, rooted in our territory but looking far beyond it.”  Matteo is an actor and theatre educator and has spent his life in Carrara. He says he mounts his resistance to extractivism through cultural and political action. Together with others, he co-founded Fuoriluogo, an independent cultural group that produces satire, music and counter-narratives, rejecting corporate values and promoting alternative visions for Carrara’s future. It is part of a small creative scene that has taken root in Carrara. Some artists have come here from elsewhere in Italy, as well as from other European countries and even as far afield as China, to join this artistic renaissance. Others have chosen to stay here after studying at the local Fine Arts Academy, drawn by the town’s ancient sculptural legacy and its peculiar mix of decay and enchantment. Rosmunda moved to Carrara more than a decade ago to attend the Academy and never left. Today, she creates visual art in a studio next door to an old anarchist print shop. The autonomous print shop “La Cooperativa Tipolitografica”, which the space taken up by her studio was originally part of, was founded in 1974 as a place where the anarchist movement could publish its books, newspapers, posters, pamphlets and flyers.  Carrara’s connection to anarchism began nearly 150 years ago, when anarchist ideals found fertile ground among the downtrodden workers in the marble quarries. Led by Alberto Meschi, Carrara’s quarrymen became the first in Italy to win a six-and-a-half-hour workday in the early 20th century. Anarchist circles and collectives emerged in nearly every town and neighbourhood across the Carrara region. In Gragnana, a village in the Apuan Alps, Italy’s oldest anarchist circle, “Errico Malatesta”, founded in 1885, still operates to this day. “I’m one of those who love this town and want it to thrive,” says Rosmunda, who believes the town has been hard-hit by years of austerity policies, introduced by the government following the global financial crisis of 2008, and underinvestment. Only a small part of marble-extraction profits now flow back to the municipality, and Carrara and surrounding villages have been left with inadequate social housing, stripped-down health and childcare services and failing public transport. “It’s hard - there’s no social welfare, public services are falling apart,” Rosmunda says. “The wealth [from marble] stays in very few hands.” Sculptor Chantal Stropeni adds: “Carrara is a paradox. There’s immense wealth - marble - and yet deep poverty, even among artists. To resist, we’ve formed a collective sculpture studio called Ponte di Ferro. There are 14 of us. We want to approach art differently - collectively. Carrara is a workshop: It’s easy to create here, but incredibly hard to see. The town is falling apart, and maybe that works in its favour: No one pays attention, no one asks questions.” In the meantime, the mountains are disappearing - at a rate of 4 million to 5 million tonnes per year. The town is growing poorer. Automation has replaced many quarry jobs such as block cutting, drilling, splitting, chiselling and materials removal. Local jobs have dropped from 800 to about 600 in recent years. But resistance in this region has a long legacy. “We’ve been fighting to reduce the impact of the extractive system - organising events, protests, talks and legal actions - for more than 30 years,” says Paola Antonioli, president of Legambiente Carrara, an Italian environmental nonprofit organisation. “Sure, the road is long. But something is shifting. Collective consciousness is beginning to awaken.” This took on new strength in 2019 with the formation of Fridays for Future Carrara, which followed the example set by environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg and holds protests on Fridays in the town.  Alongside Legambiente, a network of local environmental organisations and grassroots groups are working in this same direction. Together, they organise hikes, events, protests and awareness campaigns against marble extraction, calling for community control over common resources such as water, transparency over quarry concessions and stronger environmental and labour protections. Some have taken legal action against individual companies and government administrative departments over the private commercial use of what they see as public land. Today, Carrara is a battleground. “Carrara is like this,” Chantal says. “But it won’t always be. Not if we keep creating. Keep resisting. Keep living here, in this paradox.” Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2025/5/11/resistance-and-extractivism-inside-carrara-italys-home-of-white-marble"
"features","Anger in Israel as Netanyahu’s war choices threaten captives’ fate in Gaza","10 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","Israeli reservists increasingly refuse duty, citing exhaustion from repeated tours supporting a war with no clear end. To prioritise the release of the captives in Gaza, or to continue fighting what critics are calling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “forever war” – that is the question increasingly dividing Israel. Israel’s government, laser-focused on the idea of a total victory against Hamas in Gaza, appears to be opting for the latter. And that is only increasing the criticism Netanyahu has received since October 2023, firstly for his government’s failure to stop the October 7 attack, and then for failing to end a now 19-month war, or provide a clear vision for what the “day after” in Gaza will look like. Netanyahu’s decision in March to unilaterally end a ceasefire instead of continuing with an agreement that would have brought home the remaining captives has widened the cracks within Israeli society, as opponents realised that the likelihood of the captives leaving Gaza alive was becoming more remote. In recent weeks, a wave of open letter writing from within military units has emerged protesting the government’s priorities. The discontent has also gained traction with the public. Earlier this month, thousands of Israelis gathered outside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv to protest against Netanyahu’s decision to call up a further 60,000 reservists as part of his escalation against the bombed out and besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza, where his forces have already killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children. In mid-April, current and former members of the air force, considered one of Israel’s elite units, also released a letter, claiming the war served the “political and personal interests” of Netanyahu, “and not security ones”. Prompted by the air force, similar protests came from members of the navy, elite units within the military and Israel’s foreign security agency, Mossad.    Political and personal interests Accusations that Netanyahu is manipulating the war for his own personal ends predate the breaking of the ceasefire. In the minds of his critics, the longer the war continues, the longer Netanyahu feels he can defend himself against the numerous threats to his position and even his freedom. In addition to facing trial on numerous counts of corruption dating back to 2019, he also faces calls to hold an inquiry into the government’s political failings before the October 7 attack. Netanyahu also faces accusations that members of his office have allegedly been taking payment from Qatar – the Gulf state has previously dismissed the allegations as a “smear campaign” intended to hinder efforts to mediate an end to the conflict. The continuation of the war allows Netanyahu to distract from those issues, while maintaining a coalition with far-right parties who have made it clear that any end to the war without total victory – which increasingly appears to include the ethnic cleansing of Gaza – would result in their departure from government, and Netanyahu’s likely fall. And so there are questions about whether Netanyahu’s announcement of a further escalation in Gaza, including the occupation of territory and displacement of its population, will mark an end to the conflict, or simply bog Israel down in the kind of forever war that has so far been to Netanyahu’s benefit. ‘I don’t know if they’re capable of occupying the territory,” former US Special Forces commander, Colonel Seth Krummrich of international security firm Global Guardian told Al Jazeera, “Gaza is just going to soak up people, and that’s before you even think about guarding northern Israel, confronting Iran or guarding the Israeli street,” he said, warning of the potential shortfall in reservists. “It’s also competing with a tide of growing [domestic] toxicity. When soldiers don’t return home, or don’t go, that’s going to tear at the fabric of Israeli society. It plays out at every dinner table.”    Staying at home Israeli media reports suggest that part of that toxicity is playing out in the number of reservists simply not showing up for duty. The majority of those refusing service are thought to be “grey refusers”. That is, reservists with no ideological objection to the mass killings in Gaza, but rather ones exhausted by repeated tours, away from their families and jobs to support a war with no clear end. Official numbers of reservists refusing duty are unknown. However, in mid-March, the Israeli national broadcaster, Kan, ran a report disputing official numbers, which claimed that more than 80 percent of those called up for duty had attended, suggesting that the actual figure was closer to 60 percent. “There has been a steady increase in refusal among reservists,” a spokesperson for the organisation New Profile, which supports people refusing enlistment, said. “However, we often see sharp spikes in response to specific shifts in Israeli government policy, such as the violation of the most recent ceasefire or public statements by officials indicating that the primary objective of the military campaign is no longer the return of hostages and ‘destruction of Hamas’, as initially claimed, but rather the occupation of Gaza, and its ethnic cleansing.” Also unaddressed is growing public discontent over the ultra-religious Haredi community, whose eight-decade exemption from military service was deemed illegal by the Supreme Court in June of last year. Despite the shortfall in reservists reporting for duty and others having experienced repeated deployments, in April, the Supreme Court requested an explanation from Netanyahu – who relies upon Haredi support to maintain his coalition – as to why its ruling had not been fully implemented or enforced.    Throughout the war, Netanyahu’s escalations, while often resisted by the captives’ families and their allies, have been cheered on and encouraged by his allies among the far-right, many of whom claim a biblical right to the homes and land of Palestinians. The apparent conflict between the welfare of the captives and the “total victory” promised by Netanyahu has run almost as long as the conflict itself, with each moment of division seemingly strengthening the prime minister’s position through the critical support of the ultranationalist elements of his cabinet. Netanyahu’s position has led to conflict with politicians, including his own former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. While Gallant wasn’t opposed to the war in principle – his active support for Netanyahu eventually led to him joining Netanyahu in facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes – his prioritisation of the captives put him at odds with the prime minister. The divide over priorities has meant that civility between the government and the captives’ families has increasingly gone out the window, with Netanyahu generally avoiding meeting families with loved ones still captive in Gaza, and far-right politicians engaging in shouting matches with them during meetings in parliament. Division within Israeli society was not new, Professor Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House told Al Jazeera, “but wars and conflicts deepen them”. “Now we have a situation where some people have served anywhere up to 400 days in the army [as reservists], while others are refusing to serve at all and exploiting their political power within the coalition to do so,” Mekelberg added. “Elsewhere, there are ministers on the extreme right talking about ‘sacrificing’ the hostages for military gain,” something Mekelberg said many regarded as running counter to much of the founding principles of the country and the Jewish faith. “There’s such toxicity in public discourse,” Mekelberg continued, “We see toxicity against anyone who criticises the war or the prime minister, division between the secular and the religious, and then even divisions within the religious movements.”             Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/10/netanyahus-war-choices-fuel-discord-in-israel-over-captives-fate-in-gaza"
"features","‘A deep love’: The Nabatieh Monday Market rises after Israeli destruction","10 May 2025","Dana Hourany","Nabatieh’s weekly market was destroyed in Israel’s war on Lebanon, but vendors and customers are returning to breathe life back into its alleys. Nabatieh, Lebanon – It is a bitterly cold February morning, and Sanaa Khreiss tugs her cardigan tighter as she begins unloading her van. The sharp bite of early spring has kept most people away from the Nabatieh souk, but not Sanaa and her husband, Youssef. The market is quiet as the sun breaks through the grey clouds, except for a few vendors setting up. Sanaa, who has sold at this spot for the past four years, moves with the calm precision of someone who has perfected her craft over time. She arranges the lingerie she sells, piece by piece, carefully lining them up, each addition bringing a touch of colour and vibrancy to her stall. The soft murmur of voices grows as more vendors arrive, helping each other set up canopies to shield their stalls from potential rain. The task is far from easy. The wind tugs at the fabric, and some canopies still hold water from the recent rainfall. But they press on, and slowly, the white shapes pop up, and Nabatieh’s Monday Market has started. Sanaa smiles at the occasional passer-by, her warmth never fading. She has come to know many by name and can anticipate their requests. Her voice is quiet but inviting. “I choose the Monday Market because there’s always a lot of movement, and it’s a historic, popular spot in the south,” Sanaa tells Al Jazeera, her fingers brushing over lace and satin as she unpacks more items from the van. In the stall next door, her husband Youssef (commonly known as Abu Ali) works in silence. His movements are precise, almost meditative, but there is a hint of tension in how he arranges the containers and cookware. Youssef has never imagined himself here; he used to be a driver for the Khiam municipality, but lost his job when the municipality ceased operations after the outbreak of the Israeli war on Lebanon in 2023, which particularly devastated Lebanon’s south, including Nabatieh, one of the region’s biggest cities. Since then, Youssef has quietly adapted to the life of a vendor beside Sanaa. Youssef is quiet and reserved, a stark contrast to Sanaa’s extroverted warmth. He focuses intently on his tasks, but when approached by a customer, his blue eyes shine with welcome, and his voice is friendly. At first glance, no one would guess the weight those eyes carry – war, displacement, losing his livelihood and their home in Khiam. But at the market, it is business as usual. Shoes, toys, spices, clothing, books, food, electronics, and accessories – the Monday Market sells all that and more. The Monday Market in Nabatieh has its roots in the late Mamluk era (1250–1517 AD) and continued to thrive under Ottoman rule. Along with the Souk of Bint Jbeil and the Khan Market in Hasbaiyya, it is one of the oldest weekly markets in south Lebanon, established as part of efforts to extend trade routes across the region. Back then, traders moved between Palestine and Lebanon, transporting goods by mule and donkey over rough, slow roads. Nabatieh’s location made it a natural stop – a bustling centre where merchants from nearby villages would gather to buy, sell and rest before continuing their journeys. The market also sat along a wider network of internal pilgrimage routes, connecting Jerusalem to Damascus, Mecca and Najaf. Nabatieh Mayor Khodor Kodeih recounts that merchants travelling between Palestine and Lebanon would stop at a “khan” – an inn that also served as a trading centre – on the current market site. A khan typically featured a square courtyard surrounded by rooms on two levels, with open arcades. Merchants would rest, trade and display their goods there, gradually transforming the site into the bustling Monday Market. Over time, the market has become more than just a place to buy and sell – it is a ritual that stitches together the social and economic fabric of southern Lebanon. The area around the old khans expanded into a larger open-air souk. Israeli air strikes during the last war destroyed the original khans, but traces of the market’s past still remain. Today, the Monday Market spans three to four city blocks in central Nabatieh, surrounded by remnants of Ottoman-era architecture. While shops remain open throughout the week, the market itself is made up of temporary stalls and stands that operate only on Mondays. Before Israel’s recent war on Lebanon, the market filled the streets, framed by Ottoman-era buildings with wooden shutters and iron balconies. Merchants packed the narrow alleys with vibrant goods, their calls for business filling the air. But on November 13, 2024, Israeli air strikes reduced the historic market to rubble. Stone arches crumbled, shopfronts burned, and what was once a bustling hub was left in ruins. Arriving at Sultan Square, the usual site of the old market, one is left confused. All that remains is a vast, empty space at the heart of the city. The famous Al-Sultan sweet shop, after which the square was named, is gone. Nearby, other sweet shops – including al-Dimassi, established in 1949 and central to Nabatieh’s culinary identity and reputation – are also missing. They once sold staples of Lebanese dessert culture: baklava, nammoura, maamoul, and during Ramadan, seasonal treats like kallaj and an all-time favourite, halawet el-jibn. Every market morning, merchants sweep the streets, using only brooms to push the debris to the sides and clear space for their stalls. Even as the wind blows rubble back towards their stand, they keep sweeping, determined to maintain a neat and orderly market. Sanaa remembers the high-end lingerie shops that once competed with her; they’re gone too, reduced to debris amid which vendors have set up their tents as they wait for the municipality to clear the area. There should be more vendors on that cold morning, but the rain and war have changed things. “The good thing about rainy days,” Sanaa jokes, “is that there are fewer merchants, so customers have limited options.” Before the war, she sold in bulk – new brides buying trousseaus, women stocking up. Now, purchases are small and careful – with homes and livelihoods lost, shopping is for necessity, not luxuries or impulse buys. On a typical Monday, the market runs from 5am to 5pm. Merchants arrive early, making their way to their designated spots, some on the pavement, others against a backdrop of a collapsed building. Vegetable vendors lay their produce out in large sacks and plastic crates. Normally, the market is so crowded with people that cars can’t pass and visitors have to squeeze past each other from one stall to the next. Though profits aren’t what they used to be, Sanaa is just happy to be back. She’s kept her prices the same, hoping the market will rebound. “This is the most important market in the south,” she says. “And we need to follow the source of our livelihood.” Next to Sanaa’s stall is Jihad Abdallah’s, where he has rigged up several racks to hang his collection of women’s sports clothes. Yesterday’s snow is melting as the sun comes out, but Jihad keeps his hoodie up, still feeling the lingering cold. Customers have started trickling over, but it isn’t enough to shake the frustrated, tired look on his face. Jihad, from the border village of Bint Jbeil, spends his week travelling between different town markets in southern Lebanon to make ends meet. He was among the first to set up in Bint Jbeil’s Thursday Market as soon as the ceasefire with Israel was announced on November 27, 2024. Jihad didn’t have many options. Bint Jbeil was the market he knew best – he memorised the rhythms, understood customer demands, and recognised how to turn profit. Still, business was slow. “In Bint Jbeil, the market needs time to recover because many residents from nearby villages, like Blida, Aitaroun and Maroun al-Ras, haven’t returned yet,” Abdallah tells Al Jazeera. “However, in Nabatieh, nearby towns have seen more returnees.” Jihad was also among the first to return to the Nabatieh market, joining the very first band of merchants in clearing as much debris as they could manage. “The Israelis want to make this land unlivable, but we’re here. We’re staying,” Jihad says. “They destroyed everything out of spite, but they can’t take our will.” Further down the road, Abbas Sbeity has set up his stand of clothes for the day, a collection of children’s winter clothes he couldn’t sell because of the war. “I had to empty my van to make room for mattresses for my kids to sleep on when we first escaped Qaaqaait al-Jisr [a village near Nabatieh],” he tells Al Jazeera, pointing to the van behind him, now packed with clothes. Abbas is trying to make a profit, however small, from clothes that were meant to be sold when children returned to school last fall. He’s been coming to the Monday Market for 30 years, a job passed down from his father, who inherited it from his grandfather. “My grandfather used to bring me here on a mule!” he says with a nostalgic smile. For a moment, he stares off, lost in thought. His smile stays, but his voice holds a trace of sadness. “There’s a deep love story with the Monday Market,” he adds. “But now, there’s a sadness in the air. People’s spirits are still heavy, and the destruction around us really affects their morale.” Abbas remembers how people came not only to buy but to hang out for a weekly outing they could count on for fun, no matter the weather. Even if they didn’t buy anything, they’d enjoy the crowds or grab a bite, whether from the small shops selling manouches, shawarma, kaak or falafel sandwiches, or from a restaurant nearby, from local favourites like Al-Bohsasa to Western chains. Many would also stop by Al-Sultan and Al-Dimassi, which were the closest to the market, to enjoy a sweet treat, a perfect way to top off their visit. By noon, the rain had stopped, leaving behind a gloomy day as the sun struggled to break through the clouds, casting a faint light over the market. People haggled over prices, searched for specific sizes, and despite the changes brought by war, the Monday Market pressed on, determined to hold on to its place. At one end of the Sultan Square, near the upper right corner, a half-destroyed building still stands where vendors used to set up shop before the war. Now, produce vendors arrange their stalls beneath it as if nothing had changed. The remnants of the structure loom above them – fragments of walls hanging precariously, held together by stray wires that look ready to snap. Yet the vendors paid no mind, too absorbed in tending to customers. The building’s arched openings and ornate details, though battered, still hinted at the city’s rich past. Its verandas, standing like silent witnesses to the souk below, bore testament to both the scars of war and a culture that refused to disappear. At the far end of the market, by the main road leading out of Nabatieh to nearby villages, one cart stands alone, piled high with nuts and dried fruits. Its owner adds more, making the stacks look like they might spill over at any second. Roasted corn, chickpeas, and almonds sit next to raw almonds, hazelnuts, cashews and walnuts. Dried fruits are displayed front and centre, dates and apricots taking the spotlight. At the back of the cart, Rachid Dennawi arranges candies – gummy bears and marshmallows in all shapes and flavours. It’s his first day back at the Monday Market since the war began. Abir Badran, a customer dressed in a dark cardigan and a long black scarf that gently frames her face, is the first to reach Rachid’s cart while he’s still setting up. Her face lights up as she leans in to examine the dates, carefully picking through them. “Finally, you’re back!” she says, reaching for the dates – they’re bigger and better than what she can find at other places, she says. Rachid, originally from Tripoli in Lebanon’s north, makes the three-hour journey to Nabatieh because he believes the market is livelier, has more customers. Over time, Rachid has built a loyal clientele, and people like Abir swear by his dried fruit and nut mix. “The people here are different,” he tells Al Jazeera, handing Abir a handful of almonds to taste. “They don’t just buy from you – they welcome you and want you to succeed.” But Abir didn’t just come to stock up – she is there because the Monday Market has become an act of resistance. “The Israelis want to sever our ties to this land,” Abir tells Al Jazeera. “But we won’t let them.” While the optimism is clear, the reality on the ground is tough. Merchants and residents are doing what they can with what they have. Some have relocated their shops or started new businesses, but some are stuck in limbo. Mayor Kodeih estimates it will take at least two years to rebuild the market and is critical of the Lebanese government’s support. “We will restore the market,” he says. “It won’t be the same, but we’ll bring it back.” The mayor was injured in the Israeli strike on the municipality in mid-October, which killed 16 people; he is one of the two survivors. It is not easy to leave the market behind – or Nabatieh. Despite the destruction, the city hums with life: Shops are open, cafes are busy, and people lean in doorways, greeting passers-by with warm smiles and easy conversation. The gravity of war has left its mark. The destruction is visible at every turn – a bookshop reduced to rubble, shops flattened to the ground – but it has not stripped away the city’s kindness or its sense of humour. In front of a lot with nothing more than a gaping hole in it, a playful banner by the shop that used to stand there reads: “We’ll be back soon … we’re just redecorating.” One of the paths out of the Sultan Square leads visitors northeast, into a quieter neighbourhood of cobbled streets, where cafes and small shops line the way. Here, people sip coffee and linger by storefronts, seemingly untouched by the devastation only steps away. Turning back at the boundary between the two, the destruction that has decimated the market is more apparent, as is the loss to Nabatieh and southern Lebanon. The market’s heyday will live on only in the memories of those who experienced it, younger generations will never have that same experience.

"features","Reporting from behind shifting front lines in Myanmar’s civil war","10 May 2025","Emily Fishbein","Journalists with the Shan State-based news outlet Shwe Phee Myay continue to report amid civil war and military repression. On a typical day, Mai Rupa travels through his native Shan State, in eastern Myanmar, documenting the impact of war. A video journalist with the online news outlet Shwe Phee Myay, he travels to remote towns and villages, collecting footage and conducting interviews on stories ranging from battle updates to the situation for local civilians living in a war zone. His job is fraught with risks. Roads are strewn with landmines and there are times when he has taken cover from aerial bombing and artillery shelling. “I have witnessed countless people being injured and civilians dying in front of me,” Mai Rupa said. “These heartbreaking experiences deeply affected me,” he told Al Jazeera, “at times, leading to serious emotional distress.” Mai Rupa is one of a small number of brave, independent journalists still reporting on the ground in Myanmar, where a 2021 military coup shattered the country’s fragile transition to democracy and obliterated media freedoms. Like his colleagues at Shwe Phee Myay – a name which refers to Shan State’s rich history of tea cultivation – Mai Rupa prefers to go by a pen name due to the risks of publicly identifying as a reporter with one of the last remaining independent media outlets still operating inside the country. Most journalists fled Myanmar in the aftermath of the military’s takeover and the expanding civil war. Some continue their coverage by making cross-border trips from work bases in neighbouring Thailand and India. But staff at Shwe Phee Myay – a Burmese-language outlet, with roots in Shan State’s ethnic Ta’ang community – continue reporting from on the ground, covering a region of Myanmar where several ethnic armed groups have for decades fought against the military and at times clashed with each other. After Myanmar’s military launched a coup in February 2021, Shwe Phee Myay’s journalists faced new risks. In March that year, two reporters with the outlet narrowly escaped arrest while covering pro-democracy protests. When soldiers and police raided their office in the northern Shan State capital of Lashio two months later, the entire team had already gone into hiding. That September, the military arrested the organisation’s video reporter, Lway M Phuong, for alleged incitement and dissemination of “false news”. She served nearly two years in prison. The rest of the 10-person Shwe Phee Myay team scattered following her arrest, which came amid the Myanmar military’s wider crackdown on the media. Spread out across northern Shan State in the east of the country, the news team initially struggled to continue their work. They chose to avoid urban areas where they might encounter the military. Every day was a struggle to continue reporting. “We couldn’t travel on main roads, only back roads,” recounted Hlar Nyiem, an assistant editor with Shwe Phee Myay. “Sometimes, we lost four or five work days in a week,” she said. Despite the dangers, Shwe Phee Myay’s reporters continued with their clandestine work to keep the public informed. When a magnitude 7.7 earthquake hit central Myanmar on March 28, killing more than 3,800 people, Shwe Phee Myay’s journalists were among the few able to document the aftermath from inside the country. The military blocked most international media outlets from accessing earthquake-affected areas, citing difficulties with travel and accommodation, and the few local reporters still working secretly in the country took great risks to get information to the outside world. “These journalists continue to reveal truths and make people’s voices heard that the military regime is desperate to silence,” said Thu Thu Aung, a public policy scholar at the University of Oxford who has conducted research on Myanmar’s post-coup media landscape. On top of the civil war and threats posed by Myanmar’s military regime, Myanmar’s journalists have encountered a new threat. In January, the administration of US President Donald Trump and his billionaire confidante Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) began dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). USAID had allocated more than $268m towards supporting independent media and the free flow of information in more than 30 countries around the world – from Ukraine to Myanmar, according to journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders. In February, The Guardian reported on how the freezing of USAID funds created an “existential crisis” for exiled Myanmar journalists. The situation worsened further in mid-March, when the White House declared plans for the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to reduce operations to the bare minimum. USAGM oversees – among others – the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which were both leading providers of news on Myanmar.    Last week, RFA announced it was laying off 90 percent of its staff and ceasing to produce news in the Tibetan, Burmese, Uighur and Lao languages. VOA has faced a similar situation. Tin Tin Nyo, managing director of Burma News International, a network of 16 local, independent media organisations based inside and outside Myanmar, said the loss of the Burmese-language services provided by VOA and RFA created a “troubling information vacuum”. Myanmar’s independent media sector also relied heavily on international assistance, which had already been dwindling, Tin Tin Nyo said. Many local Myanmar news outlets were already “struggling to continue producing reliable information”, as a result of the USAID funding cuts brought in by Trump and executed by Musk’s DOGE, she said. Some had laid off staff, reduced their programming or suspended operations. “The downsizing of independent media has decreased the capacity to monitor [false] narratives, provide early warnings, and counter propaganda, ultimately weakening the pro-democracy movement,” Tin Tin Nyo said. “When independent media fail to produce news, policymakers around the world will be unaware of the actual situation in Myanmar,” she added. Currently, 35 journalists remain imprisoned in Myanmar, making it the world’s third-worst jailer of journalists after China and Israel, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The country is ranked 169th out of 180 countries on Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index. “Journalists on the ground must work under the constant fear of arrest or even death,” Tin Tin Nyo said. “The military junta treats the media and journalists as criminals, specifically targeting them to silence access to information.” Despite the dangers, Shwe Phee Myay continues to publish news on events inside Myanmar. With a million followers on Facebook – the digital platform where most people in Myanmar get their news – Shwe Phee Myay’s coverage has become even more critical since the military coup in 2021 and the widening civil war. Established in 2019 in Lashio, Shwe Phee Myay was one of dozens of independent media outlets which emerged in Myanmar during a decade-long political opening, which began in 2011 with the country’s emergence from a half-century of relative international isolation under authoritarian military rule. Pre-publication censorship ended in 2012 amid a wider set of policy reforms as the military agreed to allow greater political freedom. Journalists who had lived and worked in exile for media outlets such as the Democratic Voice of Burma, The Irrawaddy and Mizzima News began cautiously returning home. However, the country’s nascent press freedoms came under strain during the term of Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy government, which came to power in 2016 as a result of the military’s political reforms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s government jailed journalists and blocked independent media access to politically sensitive areas including Rakhine State, where the military committed a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya community and for which it now faces international charges of genocide. But the situation for independent journalists dramatically worsened following the 2021 coup. As the military violently cracked down on peaceful protests against the generals seizing power, it restricted the internet, revoked media licences and arrested dozens of journalists. That violence triggered an armed uprising across Myanmar.    Shwe Phee Myay briefly considered relocating to Thailand as the situation deteriorated after the coup, but those running the news site decided to remain in the country. “Our will was to stay on our own land,” said Mai Naw Dang, who until recently served as the editor of Burmese-to-English translations. “Our perspective was that to gather the news and collect footage, we needed to be here.” Their work then took on new intensity in October 2023, when an alliance of ethnic armed organisations launched a surprise attack on military outposts in Shan State near the border with China. The offensive marked a major escalation in the Myanmar conflict; the military, which lost significant territory as a result, retaliated with air strikes, cluster munitions and shelling. Within two months, more than 500,000 people had been displaced due to the fighting. With few outside journalists able to access northern Shan State, Shwe Phee Myay was uniquely positioned to cover the crisis.     Then in January this year, Shwe Phee Myay also received notice that USAID funds approved in November were no longer coming and it has since reduced field reporting, cancelled training and scaled back video news production. “We’re taking risks to report on how people are impacted by the war, yet our efforts seem unrecognised,” editor-in-chief Mai Rukaw said. “Even though we have a strong human resource base on the ground, we’re facing significant challenges in securing funding to continue our work.” During staff meetings, Mai Rukaw has raised the possibility of shutting down Shwe Phee Myay with his colleagues. Their response, he said, was to keep going even if the money dries up. “We always ask ourselves: if we stop, who will continue addressing these issues?” he said. “That question keeps us moving forward.”             Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/10/reporting-from-behind-shifting-front-lines-in-myanmars-civil-war"
"features","Syria’s Druze divided as sectarian tensions linger after violence","9 May 2025","Justin Salhani","Agreements to halt fighting ease tensions, but fear and mistrust linger among Druze and other minorities in post-Assad Syria. Instability has plagued Syria in the past two weeks after fighting broke out in two of Damascus’s suburbs and a southern governorate, drawing in government forces and non-state armed factions. Using the unrest as a pretext, Israel also launched attacks on several locations in Syria. The fighting and the Israeli attacks add to the difficulties faced by Syria’s new government – which only came to power after the fall of longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad –  as it attempts to rebuild Syria after nearly 14 years of war. The violence of that war has not fully subsided. Instead, the recent fighting has taken on a sectarian character, though locals also told Al Jazeera that some actors were motivated by power as they try to carve out spheres of influence in the new Syria.    The recent clashes began on April 28 in the town of Jaramana, on the outskirts of Damascus, before spreading to nearby Ashrafiyat Sahnaya and the southern governorate of Sweida, where many of the country’s Druze population live. All of the areas have significant Druze populations, and the violence began after attackers were incensed by a blasphemous audio recording criticising the Prophet Muhammad, attributed to a religious leader from the minority group. The religious leader denied the recording was in his voice, and an investigation by Syria’s Ministry of the Interior has concurred. But it mattered little, as fighting between local armed Druze groups and outsiders began. The violence was followed by several Israeli attacks, including one near Syria’s presidential palace in Damascus. Syria’s government called it a “dangerous escalation”. Israel’s military has struck Syria hundreds of times since the fall of al-Assad, while Syria has yet to retaliate and has indicated that it has been involved in non-direct talks with Israel to calm the situation. Israel has attempted to portray its latest attacks in Syria as evidence that it is a defender of the Druze, many of whom live in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a joint statement with Defense Minister Israel Katz, saying the attack was “a clear message to the Syrian regime: We will not allow [Syrian] forces to deploy south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community.” But many officials in Syria’s Druze community have expressed an openness to working with the new authority in Damascus and denied Israel’s overtures that claim to protect them. Sources told Al Jazeera that these recent clashes have not altered that view on Israel. “Israel is protecting its own interests,” Ali Jarbou, a professor at Damascus University and a member of a prominent Druze family, told Al Jazeera. “They are not protecting anyone. Not the Druze or anyone else.” Experts have said Israel prefers to have weak states on its borders, and is therefore attacking Syria to weaken the new government and prevent it from exercising its power over the whole country. Allying with regional minority groups may also appear attractive to some in Israel, although a similar strategy in the past, most notably in Lebanon during the 1975-1990 civil war, failed. But the Israeli government is also facing internal pressure to act from its own Druze community, the vast majority of whom are supportive of the Israeli state and serve in the Israeli army, despite being Arabic-speaking.    The Druze community in the Middle East is split between Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and a small community in Jordan. They have played an influential role across these countries – in Syria, one of the leaders of the country’s independence was a famous Druze named Sultan al-Atrash. Syria’s Druze are mostly split between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Mount Hermon, Sweida (in an area called Jabal al-Druze, or Mountain of the Druze), and a couple of Damascus’s suburbs, while there is also a small community near Idlib. Syrians in the occupied Golan Heights live under Israeli authority but most have rejected offers of Israeli citizenship. They’ve also historically been able to keep ties to Syria, sometimes studying in Damascus or marrying across the border, according to Tobias Lang, director of the Austrian Centre for Peace, who has extensively studied the Druze community in the Levant. The Druze in Syria are, however, “very fragmented politically”, Lang said, due to years of life under the al-Assad dictatorship. “No distinct Druze leadership was allowed to emerge, and the traditional leadership lost much of its power to the Baathist regime,” he said, referring to the Baath party, which ruled Syria from 1963 to 2024. During the war in Syria, competing voices emerged within the Druze community. Some, like Hikmat al-Hijri, the top Druze religious figure in Syria, initially supported the al-Assad regime. Others, like Wahid al-Balous, founder of the Men of Dignity Movement, split off from the regime much earlier and refused to send local men to die in support of the government. Al-Balous was later assassinated in 2015. Opposition figures blamed the regime. In 2023, when antigovernment protests erupted in Sweida, al-Hijri finally turned against al-Assad and supported the local opposition. Al-Hijri has also been sharply critical of the new Syrian authorities since the outbreak of violence last month, calling the attacks against the Druze a “genocidal campaign”. “We no longer trust a group that calls itself a government, because the government doesn’t kill its own people through extremist gangs that are loyal to it, and after the massacre claims they are loose forces,” al-Hijri said. The Syrian government has denied any involvement in the attacks on the Druze, and has instead emphasised that its forces have sought to provide security and prevent any further sectarian attacks.    Agreements struck between local actors and the new government at the start of this month have ended the fighting for now. But dozens of people had been killed, many civilians among them. In Jaramana, locals are still on high alert. “We’re scared of our neighbours,” a resident told Al Jazeera, requesting anonymity for fear of retaliation against them or their family. In the early days after the fall of al-Assad, places like Jaramana and Sweida were hesitant to work with the new Syrian government. Local leaders, some of whom are Druze notables, demanded a say in local governance and security matters. But members of the Druze community have now been working with the central authority in Damascus to calm tensions, resolve disputes, and negotiate security arrangements. Some of those agreements will see locals join the new government’s internal security force and police their own areas under the central government’s authority. Still, locals are on edge after the clashes and fear they could restart. Locals told Al Jazeera that some Syrians, particularly from minority sects like the Druze, have had their faith in the new central authority shaken. “Trust [in the new government] began to decrease after the events on the coast,” Jarbou said, referring to attacks in early March on Alawite – another minority community – in the coastal region after government forces were attacked. Hundreds were killed, many of them civilians, and while the government quickly announced an investigation into the attacks, the violence provided evidence for those fearful of the new order in Syria. Syria has lived through 14 years of war and more than five decades of brutal dictatorship. For many in the country, the fall of Assad was a welcomed reprieve. For others, the fear and uncertainty from the Assad era has not completely dissipated. “In other words, we can say that the war hasn’t stopped,” Jarbou said, adding that a serious, participatory political solution is needed for the country. Should that not come to pass, the current pattern of clashes and increased communal tensions will only worsen. “Sedition is raging,” he said. “It’s not that we’re afraid of sedition. We’re in sedition now.”             Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/9/syrias-druze-divided-as-sectarian-tensions-linger-after-violence"
"features","Vladimir Putin: After 25 years in power, what next for Russia’s president?","9 May 2025","Niko Vorobyov","From chasing rats as a child to the KGB, how 72-year-old Putin came to power – and what drives him now. When Russian President Vladimir Putin was growing up in a dilapidated apartment block in Leningrad, now St Petersburg, he and his friends would chase rats through the corridors with sticks. One day, a huge rat he’d cornered suddenly turned on the young Vladimir and chased him back to his quarters. “I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word cornered,” Putin recalled in a 2000 interview.     As the tale has been retold and analysed over the years, a consensus has emerged among Kremlin watchers: Putin identifies with the cornered rat, forced to lash out when he believes his survival is at stake. Putin was born in 1952, seven years after the end of World War II, in which millions of Russians died, and the wounds, both physical and emotional, were still fresh. Putin never knew his two older brothers: one, Viktor, died of hunger during the Siege of Leningrad while the other died in infancy before the war. Putin’s father, a soldier, was crippled by shrapnel from a grenade blast while his mother was reportedly distant. It was perhaps this tough upbringing that nurtured Putin’s aptitude for survival. Although childhood friends remembered him as “small, thin and rather weak” and aloof, Putin, a self-admitted “hooligan” in his youth, wasn’t afraid to fight if anyone picked on him. “People close to Putin have told me he lives by the principle that even if you’re being abused in the yard, you must resist and endure, and you will win,” exiled opposition politician Gennady Gudkov, who first met Putin in 2001, told Al Jazeera. “He wasn’t very strong, he wasn’t very tall, and that’s why he decided to get into sports – judo, sambo [a Soviet combat sport] and so on.” It was in judo class at the age of 12 that Putin met one of his lifelong friends: Arkady Rotenberg. The pair remained close, and in the cloak-and-dagger world of Russian politics, it would be old friends like Rotenberg he’d trust. In various interviews as well as her memoirs, Putin’s schoolteacher Vera Gurevich recalled a boy who fought “like a cat … with his arms and legs and teeth” but also an eager student. Under her tutelage, Putin began learning German, a skill that shaped his future career. In 1973, the wildly popular miniseries Seventeen Moments of Spring first aired on Soviet television. Set in the final days of World War II, its hero, Max Otto von Stierlitz, was a deep-cover spy infiltrating the highest echelons of the Nazi leadership. The series was commissioned by Yuri Andropov, then-head of the Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, as a propaganda project. It had a similar cultural impact on Soviet audiences as James Bond did on Western ones. While Putin has never officially acknowledged the series – although he has admitted that The Shield and the Sword, a film about a Russian spy sabotaging Nazi operations, inspired him to serve his country from the shadows – he enlisted in the KGB just two years after it aired and following his graduation in law from Leningrad State University. The image of a “cool, unusual” spy and the need to prove himself likely pushed him to join the KGB, said Gudkov, who served in the agency in the 1980s. “He is a rather clever man. He passed all the tests entering the Andropov Institute [spy academy]. Everyone entering this institution passed many, many serious tests for memory, psychological stability,” said Gudkov, who underwent the same tests. Putin’s psychological profile described him as being emotionally detached, having a “diminished sense of danger” and being prone to taking risks. As a fluent German speaker, Putin was dispatched to Dresden in East Germany in 1985. Having been occupied by the USSR after World War II, East Germany was, like much of Eastern Europe, a puppet state subservient to Moscow. Putin lived there with his then-wife, Lyudmila, whom he met at a concert and married in 1983, and their two young daughters. In Dresden, Putin’s duties, including liaising between the KGB headquarters in Moscow and their East German colleagues in the Stasi secret police, were fairly mundane. Then, in 1989, everything changed. Putin, by now a lieutenant colonel, watched communism crumble as revolutions spread and toppled governments across the Eastern Bloc, many of which had been under Moscow’s sway. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, a group of protesters tried to storm the KGB headquarters in Dresden. As the officer on duty, Putin called a Red Army tank commander for reinforcements. In the past, Soviet leaders did not hesitate to crush uprisings in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. But reformist President Mikhail Gorbachev adopted a more hands-off approach. “We cannot do anything without orders from Moscow,” the voice on the other end of the line told Putin. “And Moscow is silent.” While jubilant scenes played out on German streets, Putin viewed things differently: He saw how quickly regimes can be overthrown. The experience forged a deep-seated suspicion of popular movements, revolutions and disorder and revealed what could happen if Moscow showed weakness. It shaped his view that the Soviet decline was a “terrible thing” never to be repeated, said Sergey Radchenko, a Russian-British historian at Johns Hopkins University in the United States. Moscow’s humbling defeat in the Cold War left its mark on both Putin and many Russians, said Grigory Yavlinsky, a Russian politician and former presidential candidate for the liberal opposition party Yabloko who has met the Russian president several times since the 1990s. For Putin, it was a humiliation, he believes. In January 1990, a now 37-year-old Putin returned to a very different Russia from the one he had left. For a start, Moscow, once capital of the Communist International, now bore a symbol of capitalism – the golden arches of McDonald’s, which had just opened its first restaurant there. The Soviet Union was breaking up, its 15 republics, including Russia and Ukraine, going their separate ways. Meanwhile, the sudden leap into unrestrained capitalism caused an economic collapse, plunging the population into poverty. People lost their jobs and life savings. But the uncertainty created opportunities for some. Beginning in the late 1980s when Gorbachev’s liberalising reforms were under way, mobsters and oligarchs grabbed hold of Russia’s freewheeling economy through rigged privatisation schemes, gangland shootouts and other crooked means. Putin later referred to the USSR’s disintegration as “the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century”, lamenting the lawlessness and instability of the post-Soviet period. Back in St Petersburg, Putin found a job as an international liaison to the mayor’s office under his former law professor Anatoly Sobchak, who eventually promoted him to deputy mayor in 1994. Yavlinsky remembers his brief first meeting with Putin during this time, and finding him unassuming, inconspicuous and “closed-off”. Sobchak was Putin’s mentor. It was under him that Putin learned the machinations of politics and was introduced to the higher echelons of power. Putin later used his power to shield Sobchak from corruption allegations, and the two men remained close until Sobchak’s death in 2000 when, in a rare display of vulnerability, Putin cried at his funeral. In 1996, Putin moved to Moscow, where he networked his way into then-President Boris Yeltsin’s circle of advisers and confidants. Two years later, Putin was appointed head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the primary successor of the KGB. He’d soon prove his usefulness to his bosses: When Yeltsin came under investigation for corruption, Putin presented a tape of Russia’s then-chief prosecutor, Yurii Skuratov, with two young naked women, and Skuratov soon lost his job. Yeltsin went on to pick Putin as his successor, first appointing him prime minister. His rise to power was enthusiastically supported by the oligarchs, who by the mid-1990s were Russia’s ruling class. Boris Berezovsky, an influential figure within Yeltsin’s inner circle, had known Putin since the early 1990s and, impressed by him, even offered to take him skiing in the Swiss Alps. (The future president, an enthusiastic skier, accepted.) Gudkov said associates of Berezovsky told him that sometime in the 1990s, the oligarch asked Putin what he wanted to be. He replied: “I want to be like you. I want to have a lot of money and influence.” After his move to Moscow, Berezovsky believed Yeltsin’s loyal spymaster could become a useful front man for his own interests – maintaining the oligarchic system while Berezovsky continued pulling the strings of power from behind the scenes. He and fellow media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky used their newspapers and television stations to transform the ex-KGB agent from a political nobody to a national leader, running smear stories on his opponents. Around this time, another episode shaped Putin’s public image. From 1994 to 1996, rebels from the breakaway republic of Chechnya in the North Caucasus mountains successfully routed Russian forces, winning de facto independence but earning a reputation as a rogue state. Fighting resumed in 1999, and a series of apartment block bombings blamed on Chechen fighters rocked Russian cities that September, killing more than 300 civilians. Putin promised to “waste the terrorists in the outhouse”. Putin oversaw the military operation against Chechen fighters, and his subsequent crushing of the resistance from 1999 to 2000 and the unrest that followed won back national honour in the eyes of many Russians. The Chechen capital, Grozny, came under such fierce bombardment that in 2003, the United Nations designated it as “the most destroyed city on Earth” with virtually no building left unscathed. Putin was perceived as strong and decisive, unlike Yeltsin, whom the Russian public saw as a drunkard and was once found staggering through Washington, DC, in his underwear searching for pizza. Putin’s popularity surged, and it wasn’t long before he was giving the executive orders. Traditionally, on the night of December 31, the president of Russia addresses the nation a few minutes before the New Year. On that evening in 1999, a weary Yeltsin appeared on national television and unexpectedly announced he was handing over the reins of power. Yeltsin’s approval rating at the time was estimated to be as low as 2 percent, and he also suffered from health issues. The camera then cut to Putin, now appearing before a bewildered nation as acting president just before the clock struck midnight, ringing in the new millennium. “The powers of the head of state have been turned over to me today,” he informed the public. “I assure you that there will be no vacuum of power, not for a minute.” In just a few months, he had become Russia’s most popular politician. But Putin maintained his loyalty to Yeltsin. His first presidential decree granted the scandal-mired former president immunity from prosecution. A few months later, Putin won the presidential election in a landslide. A former secret agent stoically devoted to the motherland – an article in Russia’s Kommersant magazine lionised him as a real-life Stierlitz. Although Putin revealed little about the direction he was taking the country, a manifesto – Russia at the Turn of the Millennium – published about this time, held clues. Putin lamented Russia’s decline in the 1990s as a result of both communism – which he accused of “dooming” the country “along a dead-end route” for seven decades – and Western neoliberalism, which he referred to as “abstract models and schemes taken from foreign textbooks to Russian soil”. Instead, he emphasised stability (“Russia has exhausted its limit for political and socioeconomic upheavals”) and called for a strong, centralised state as a “guarantor of order”. Putin’s early presidency also coincided with a hike in oil prices that drastically boosted the quality of life in Russia after the poverty-stricken previous decade. In his first year in power, 22 out of every 1,000 Russians owned a mobile phone compared, for instance, with about half of all Americans. By 2006, almost every Russian had one. Meanwhile, male life expectancy rose from a low of 57 in 1994 to 67 by 2005 and from 71 to 77 for women. Gudkov, who first met Putin as part of a delegation of MPs in 2001, said Putin left a positive impression of a competent leader. “He speaks very freely, very convincingly,” he recalled. “You have the impression that he is absolutely frank and sincere with you.” But the oligarchs who thought they could play Putin like a puppet were terribly mistaken. On July 29, 2000, bulletproof limousines delivered 21 of Russia’s richest men to the Kremlin, where, sitting around an enormous table in an ornate hall, Putin told them, in no uncertain terms, to stay out of his way. “The oligarchs were kingmakers in the 1990s. Especially during the 1996 polls, they played a major role in the re-election of Boris Yeltsin, who rewarded many of them with privatised state assets,” explained Kevork Oskanian, a lecturer in international relations at Exeter University in England. “Putin saw this as a threat to his own authority and used his ‘siloviki’ powerbase in the security services against them. Oligarchs had to either submit or suffer. Those who chose the latter were ruthlessly stripped of their assets and either incarcerated or exiled.” Gusinsky and Berezovsky, who by 2000 had both turned critical of how Putin was concentrating power, found themselves the subject of criminal investigations and were forced into exile that year. Oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky had political ambitions of his own and in 2003 was charged and imprisoned for fraud. His oil company was split up among Putin’s allies.     “He got them all on their knees,” Yavlinsky said. Around that time, he added, he proposed to Putin that the oligarchs repay a fair sum for their assets and become nonpolitical entrepreneurs. Putin refused. “He said that it didn’t suit him. He needed them to obey him.” What Putin seemed to value were old loyalties, which he counted on as he smashed the established oligarchy and replaced it with his own clique. “As I know from people in very close proximity with Putin, he doesn’t like to trust many people,” Gudkov said. “He’s very cautious in trusting people, and if you’re working with Putin, you must prove every day that he can trust you. He always thinks of different situations where people can change their behaviour, betray him. Maybe his caution helped him stay in the Kremlin for many, many years.” His inner circle was disparate and included those with no government experience. The new elite were the “siloviki”, or security officials; Putin’s colleagues from his days in the St Petersburg mayor’s office; and childhood friends such as his judo sparring partner Arkady Rotenberg, who was awarded lucrative government contracts, including building the Kerch Strait bridge connecting the Russian mainland with Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014. Putin may have also joined the ranks of the uber-rich. Opposition figures have accused him of amassing a vast fortune, estimated to be in the billions and exemplified in the form of Putin’s Palace, a lavish Italian-style retreat on the Black Sea coast with a casino, swimming pools and church, purportedly financed by donations from oligarchs eager to stay on the president’s good side. Rotenberg has claimed the compound is his. Over the years, it wasn’t only the oligarchs who had to fear Putin. Opponents and vocal critics have met suspicious or untimely ends. Alexander Litvinenko, who accused the FSB of staging the 1999 apartment bombings, was fatally poisoned in London in 2006. Journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who exposed atrocities in Chechnya, was shot dead in her apartment stairwell in 2006. Opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was gunned down just outside the Kremlin walls in 2015. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the mutinous boss of the Wagner mercenary outfit, was killed in an apparent grenade blast on his plane in 2023. Early in his presidency, Putin saw common cause between the US “war on terror” and his own campaign against Chechen separatists. “He had a more benevolent and inquisitive attitude towards the West [and tried] to find common ground,” Yavlinsky said. He was the first head of state to call US President George W Bush after the September 11, 2001, attacks to offer support, he said. He even wanted to join NATO and offered to help the alliance build a missile defence system “so there would be a roof all over Europe”. In 2002, he signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Bush. “He tried to find a mutual understanding,” Yavlinsky said. “But it didn’t work out.” Relations soured when it became clear that Washington had its own ideas about the world order. The 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq showed Putin the US’s willingness to assert its might as a global superpower, ignoring the concerns of the global community – including Russia – while claiming to stand for freedom and democracy. Closer to home, mass protests erupted in Ukraine in 2004 against elections alleged to be rigged in favour of the more pro-Russian candidate, Viktor Yanukovych. This event, known as the Orange Revolution, was perceived by Putin as Western – specifically US – meddling to undermine Russia’s influence over its neighbours and promote regime change. Meanwhile NATO, founded explicitly as an anti-Soviet alliance during the Cold War, had gradually been absorbing new members and inching closer towards Russia’s borders. NATO’s enforcement of a no-fly zone over Libya in 2011 allowed rebels to gain ground and topple and kill Muammar Gaddafi, famously an opponent of Western imperialism. His death deeply troubled Putin. Mikhail Zygar, a Russian journalist with sources deep in the Kremlin, wrote that Putin was “apoplectic” at the news. Then that winter, tens of thousands of people gathered at Bolotnaya Square on the banks of the Moscow River to rally against what was widely believed to be a rigged election that gave Putin yet another term in power. The mass protests, which gripped other cities as well, were the largest in modern Russian history. Hundreds were arrested or detained. “Swindlers and thieves, give back our elections!” read a banner on the Luzhkov Bridge. In Putin’s mind, this was an attempt at another Orange Revolution. By the 2011 protests, Ilya Budraitskis, a Russian historian and social scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, said Putin “was already absolutely convinced that he himself was the target of such a potential regime change”. And so when the Maidan Revolution broke out in Ukraine in 2013, overthrowing then-President Yanukovych, Putin interpreted it through the same lens. The popular uprising was, in his words, an “unconstitutional armed coup” directed from Washington. Andrey Kordochkin, a dissident Russian Orthodox priest now exiled in Germany, told Al Jazeera that an independently minded “Ukraine posed a threat to Putinism by its very existence.” “The very fact, with all its problems, of the existence of a country with a young, replaceable political elite and oriented towards Europe was a challenge – can this happen in Russia too?” The reaction was swift. Masked commandos in unmarked uniforms nicknamed “little green men”, later revealed to be Russian soldiers, occupied the Crimean Peninsula, which was then shortly annexed by Russia. Meanwhile, a Russian-backed rebellion against the central Kyiv government engulfed the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, a warm-up to the all-out invasion of 2022. Putin also embraced an ideology of loosely defined “traditional values”, initially in the background of his discourse. He cast Russia as a “protector of conservative traditions against a decadent, liberal Europe/West”, Oskanian explained. On February 24, 2022, after years of alienation from the West, Putin appeared on national television to announce the start of a “special military operation” – the invasion of Ukraine. “The expansion of NATO to the east, moving its military infrastructure closer to Russian borders” was a “fundamental threat” to his country’s security, Putin explained in a televised speech. In recent years, US intelligence and Kremlin watchers alike have speculated about how Putin’s decisions may be tied to his growing isolation. Putin had long been averse to germs, publicly scolding ministers if they coughed in front of him, and once compared those refusing to get the flu vaccine to people practising self-harm. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he strictly quarantined himself. He was rarely seen in public and refused to meet foreign dignitaries. Anyone cleared to see the president had to undergo a COVID-19 test, then pass through a “disinfection tunnel”. This squeezed his social circle even tighter. “He surrounded himself with obedient people,” Yavlinsky said. Now with Donald Trump occupying the White House, there seems to be the possibility of rapprochement between Russia and the US as Trump seems willing to compromise on the matter of Ukraine, for example, by lifting sanctions or letting Russia keep occupied territory. “At the human level, they understand each other because Trump’s logic of reasoning is business and Putin’s logic is extreme pragmatics, and as you understand, business and pragmatics are not far from each other,” Yavlinsky said. Yavlinsky, who tried to persuade Putin into agreeing to a ceasefire with Ukraine in 2023, believes the Russian president is not interested in negotiating with anyone but the US. “He is not interested in an agreement in Ukraine. He is interested in an agreement with the United States. … He is interested in big geopolitics. … In this sense, he says, ‘Let’s make a second Yalta [Conference]. Let’s make an agreement, the three of us – the United States, China and Russia – and we will divide the sphere of influence.’ This is what interests him. He is interested in the recognition of Russia as a great country.” Gudkov has another theory. “His main motivation is to hold power in any way,” the former parliamentarian said. At 72 years of age, Putin is still, like that child in the schoolyard, needing to prove himself, Gudkov believes. Putin considers Russia his personal property and the oligarchs around him his personal wallet, Gudkov said, and he understands that if he is weak, he can be overthrown. “He always has to prove that he is the strongest, … and he does not care what will happen to the Russians,” he said. “This is the main motive of his life to this day, and for the last 25 years.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/9/vladimir-putin-after-25-years-in-power-what-next-for-russias-president"
"economy","What have US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies achieved?","15 May 2025","Megha Bahree","Trump’s policies have roiled global markets and left businesses stumped on how to plan for the foreseeable future. When examining the on-again, off-again tariff proclamations of United States President Donald Trump during his second term in office, it is unclear what has actually been achieved. What is clear is that Trump’s tariff announcements have roiled global markets, wiping out trillions in value, and leaving many businesses stumped on how to plan for the future amid the never-ending uncertainty.     Within days of being sworn into office for his second term, Trump imposed 25-percent tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10 percent on China, arguing they needed to do more to stem the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migrants into the US. He soon suspended those on Canada and Mexico for 30 days – but not on China – in return for concessions on border and law enforcement. Since then, he has raised 25-percent tariffs on steel, aluminium, and auto and auto parts, and brought back levies on Mexico and Canada and doubled fentanyl-related tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20 percent. He then went back and forth on tariffs on car imports from Canada and Mexico, finally settling on a 25-percent on global car imports. Then, in April, he announced his “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries around the world, with a 10-percent baseline tariff on all countries around the world. He paused the “reciprocal” tariffs for 90 days after a bloodbath on Wall Street, but maintained the 10-percent global tax and instituted a 145-percent tax on China – which then retaliated with a 125-percent tax on US goods entering the country. Soon after, Trump started rolling back some tariffs as the US struck trade deals. The first came last week, in the form of a limited trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which kept in place the 10-percent levy on many products, but did lower US tariffs on British auto imports to 10 percent from the current 27.5 percent, annoying domestic US car-makers. But the one that everyone was watching for came earlier this week on Monday: The US and China announced a pause and scale back of tariffs for 90 days, with the US lowering its tax to 30 percent and China to 10 percent, while the two rivals hammer out a trade agreement. But even before the May 12 announcement, the US had already carved out exceptions for smartphones, computers and other tech products, that it largely imports from China. Then, per the Monday agreement, it also slashed the tariff on low-value, “de minimis” imports from China, reducing duties to 54 percent from 120 percent for items valued at up to $800. Such goods were previously brought into the US without having to pay any import duties and with minimal inspections. Such imports were heavily criticised, not only accused of flooding the country with cheap products, but for being used by traffickers to bring in drugs, including fentanyl. Fentanyl-trafficking was the justification for the initial tariffs placed on China, Mexico and Canada, so it’s not clear if the US government is still concerned about that route being potentially abused by drug hauliers. While the various tariff rollbacks and pauses have been welcomed by businesses, the respite has not removed uncertainty entirely. Brief pauses in tariffs are not sufficient for many companies to make longer-term investment or supply chain decisions.    It’s small businesses, which employ 45.9 percent of the US workforce and account for 43.5 percent of the US gross domestic product (GDP), that feel the effects most keenly because of their limited buffer, as we reported last week. There are fears that the uncertainty is taking a toll on the US economy. A Bloomberg poll of economists put the chances of a recession next year at almost 50-50, the news agency reported on Monday. And while inflation has so far been kept in check – consumer prices rose 2.3 percent in April from a year ago, down from 2.4 percent in March – economists have said they expect inflation to rise by the middle of the year, and consumer confidence has hit a 13-year low even before sky-high prices return. On Thursday Walmart, the world’s largest retailer and the biggest container importer in the US a lot of which is from China, warned it would have to start raising prices by the end of this month due to the high cost of tariffs even after they had been slashed to 30 percent. Trump has acknowledged a potential rise in prices – US children will have “two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally”, he said recently. But it’s not clear where he is headed with his tariffs, even as some companies have announced billions worth of new investments, and some that were recycling of previous ones – like Apple’s February announcement that it would invest $500bn in the US over the next four years, but which analysts said included current commitments. But that’s more a matter of the ledger for the next few years rather than jobs on the ground.

"economy","Largest US retailer Walmart warns of price hikes because of tariffs","15 May 2025",NA,"Walmart is a bellwether of US consumer health and its statement is a signpost of the impact of the trade war. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, will have to start raising prices later this month due to the high cost of tariffs, executives have warned in a clear signal that United States President Donald Trump’s trade war is filtering through to the US economy. As a bellwether of US consumer health, Walmart’s explicit statement on Thursday is also a signpost for how the trade war is affecting companies as Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low. Walmart’s shares fell 2.3 percent in morning trading after it also declined to provide a profit forecast for the second quarter, even as the company’s US comparable sales surpassed expectations in the first quarter. Net sales rose 2.5 percent to $165.6bn, a hair shy of estimates, while same-store sales were up 4.5 percent. Walmart’s quarterly adjusted profit was 61 cents per share, ahead of the analyst consensus for 58 cents per share. Many US companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of the trade war, as consumers stretch their budgets to buy everything from groceries to essentials at cheaper prices. But Walmart’s statement will resonate nationwide, as roughly 255 million people shop in its stores and online weekly around the world, and 90 percent of the US population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart. US shoppers will start to see prices rise at the end of May and certainly in June, Walmart’s Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in a CNBC interview. On a post-earnings call with analysts, he said the retailer would also have to cut back on orders as it considers price elasticity. As the largest importer of container goods in the US, Walmart is heavily exposed to tariffs, and even though the US and China reached a truce that lowered levies for imports on Chinese goods to 30 percent, that’s still a high cost to bear, executives said. “We’re very pleased and appreciative of the progress that has been made by the administration to bring tariffs down … but let me emphasise we still think that’s too high,” Rainey said on the call, referring to the tariff cuts negotiated over the weekend. “There are certain items, certain categories of merchandise that we’re dependent upon to import from other countries and the prices of those things are likely going to go up, and that’s not good for consumers,” he added.    Other retailers also said they would be boosting prices. German sandal maker Birkenstock on Thursday said it plans to raise prices globally to fully offset the impact of the US tariff of 10 percent on European Union-made goods. US consumer sentiment ebbed for a fourth straight month in April, signaling watchful purchasing, while the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted for the first time in three years during the first quarter, fanning worries of a recession. Walmart’s CEO Doug McMillon said the retailer would not be able to absorb all the tariffs’ costs because of narrow retail margins, but was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise – which primarily come from China – do not drive food prices higher. To mitigate the impact, Walmart is working with suppliers to substitute tariff-affected components, such as replacing aluminium with fibreglass, which is not subject to tariffs. Despite these efforts, McMillon noted that adjusting costs is more challenging in cases where Walmart imports food items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses from countries such as Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia. Analysts said Walmart was better positioned than rivals, as its scale enables it to lean on its suppliers and squeeze out efficiencies to shield customers from tariffs, but only so much. “There will likely be some demand destruction from tariffs; a complete wreck is unlikely,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Walmart on Thursday kept its annual sales and profit forecast intact for fiscal 2026, but withheld second-quarter operating income growth and earnings per share forecasts, citing a “fluid operating environment … [which] makes the very near term exceedingly difficult to forecast at the level and speed at which tariffs could go up”.

"economy","US DOJ investigates UnitedHealth for alleged Medicare fraud: Report","15 May 2025",NA,"The investigation comes amidst months of turmoil for the company, sending its stock plunging. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is carrying out a criminal investigation into UnitedHealth Group for possible Medicare fraud. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) first broke the story on Wednesday. UnitedHealth said it had not been notified by the DOJ about the “supposed criminal investigation reported”, and the company stood by “the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program”. The DOJ’s healthcare-fraud unit is overseeing the criminal investigation, which focuses on the company’s Medicare Advantage business practices, WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter. While the exact nature of the potential criminal allegations against UnitedHealth is unclear, it has been an active probe since at least last summer, the newspaper said. A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment to the WSJ about the fresh criminal probe. The department did not immediately respond to requests for comments from the Reuters news agency. Last week, UnitedHealth said in a regular filing that it had been “involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews”, without disclosing further details.     The new investigation follows broader scrutiny into the Medicare Advantage programme, in which Medicare-approved plans from a private company supplement regular Medicare for Americans age 65 and older by covering more services that the government-only plans do not, such as dental and vision services. In February, the WSJ reported a civil fraud investigation into UnitedHealth’s Medicare practices. The company had then said that it was unaware of any new probe. In the same month, US Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa launched an inquiry into UnitedHealth’s Medicare billing practices, requesting detailed records of the company’s compliance programme and other related documents. The DOJ earlier this month filed a lawsuit accusing three of the largest US health insurers of paying hundreds of millions of dollars in kickbacks to brokers in exchange for steering patients into the insurers’ Medicare Advantage plans. Nearly half of the 65 million people covered by Medicare, the US programme for people aged 65 and older or with disabilities, are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers. The insurers are paid a set rate for each patient, but can be paid more if patients have multiple health conditions. Standard Medicare coverage is managed by the government. The health insurer has been under pressure for months. On Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group’s CEO, Andrew Witty, stepped down unexpectedly, and the company simultaneously suspended its 2025 financial forecast due to rising medical costs, triggering an 18 percent drop in shares to a four-year low. Stephen Hemsley, who led the company for more than a decade until 2017, is taking back the reins following setbacks including the December murder of Brian Thompson, the CEO of its insurance unit, which catapulted UnitedHealth into the public consciousness.    On Thursday, after the news of the probe broke, UnitedHealth Group shares plunged 18 percent to hit a five-year low. “The stock is already in the doghouse with investors, and additional uncertainty will only pile on,” James Harlow, senior vice president at Novare Capital Management, which owns shares in UnitedHealth, told the news agency Reuters. If losses hold, UnitedHealth will be the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 index in two of the last three days. The past month’s selloff has wiped out nearly $300bn from UnitedHealth’s market capitalization, or more than half of its value since its shares hit a record high in November.

"economy","In Taiwan, AI boom prompts doubts about ditching nuclear power","15 May 2025","Chermaine Lee","Self-ruled island’s rising energy needs have rekindled the nuclear debate as last reactor is set to go offline. Taipei, Taiwan – As Taiwan prepares to shut down its last nuclear reactor, soaring energy demand driven by the island’s semiconductor industry is rekindling a heated debate about nuclear power. Taiwan’s electricity needs are expected to rise by 12-13 percent by 2030, largely driven by the boom in artificial intelligence (AI), according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Environmental group Greenpeace has estimated that the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, will by itself consume as much electricity as roughly one-quarter of the island’s some 23 million people by the same date. The self-ruled island’s soaring appetite for power complicates Taipei’s pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, which is heavily dependent on raising renewable energy production to about 60-70 percent of the total from about 12 percent at present. Nuclear power advocates argue that the energy source is the most feasible way for Taiwan to reach its competing industrial and environmental goals. On Tuesday, Taiwan’s legislature passed an amendment to allow nuclear power plants to apply for licences to extend operations beyond the existing 40-year limit. The opposition Kuomintang and Taiwan People’s Party passed the bill over the objections of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which came to power in 2016 on a pledge to achieve a “nuclear-free homeland”. The legal change will not halt Sunday’s planned closure of the last operating reactor – the No 2 reactor at the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant – though it casts doubt over the island’s longstanding opposition to nuclear power. The government said after the vote that it had no immediate plans for any future nuclear power projects, though Premier Cho Jung-tai indicated earlier that the government would not oppose the restoration of decommissioned reactors if the amendment passed. Cho said Taipei was “open” to nuclear power provided safety was ensured and the public reached a consensus on the issue. Any move to restart the local nuclear industry would, at a minimum, take years. Taiwan began its civilian nuclear programme in the 1950s with the assistance of technology from the United States. By 1990, state-owned power firm Taipower operated three plants with the capacity to generate more than one-third of the island’s electricity needs. Angelica Oung, a member of the Clean Energy Transition Alliance who supports nuclear power, said Taiwan could generate about 10 percent of its energy requirements from nuclear plants when the DDP came to power nearly a decade ago. “Energy emissions at the time were lower than now – isn’t that ridiculous?” Oung told Al Jazeera. “At the time, it was reasonable to launch the anti-nuclear policy as the public was still recovering from the devastating Fukushima nuclear disaster … but now even Japan has now decided to return to nuclear,” Oung said, referring to Tokyo’s plans to generate 20 percent of its power from the energy source by 2040. “That’s because renewables simply don’t work.” “The supply of renewable energy isn’t stable … solar energy, for example, needs the use of batteries,” Oung added. While the 2011 Fukushima disaster helped solidify opposition to nuclear power, Taiwan’s history of anti-nuclear activism stretches back decades earlier. The DPP was founded just months after the 1986 Chornobyl disaster and included an anti-nuclear clause in its charter. The following year, the Indigenous Tao people launched protests against Taipower’s policy of dumping nuclear waste on Orchid Island, helping cement the civil anti-nuclear movement. Nuclear energy attracted further negative scrutiny in the 1990s, when it emerged that about 10,000 people had been exposed to low levels of radiation due to the use of radioactive scrap metals in building materials. In 2000, Taipei halted construction of a planned fourth nuclear plant amid protests by environmental groups. A 2021 referendum proposal to restart work on the mothballed project was defeated 52.84 percent to 47.16 percent. Chia-wei Chao, research director of the Taiwan Climate Action Network, said nuclear power is not the answer to Taiwan’s energy needs. “Developing nuclear energy in Taiwan often means cutting the budget for boosting renewables, as opposed to other countries,” Chao told Al Jazeera. Chao said Taiwan’s nuclear plants were built without taking into account the risk of earthquakes and tsunamis, and that establishing a local industry that meets modern standards would be costly and difficult. “Extension of the current plants and reactors means having to upgrade the infrastructure to meet more updated safety standards and factoring in quake risks. This costs a lot, so nuclear energy doesn’t translate into cheaper electricity,” he said. Lena Chang, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia, said that reviving nuclear energy would not only be costly, but potentially dangerous, too. “We, Greenpeace, firmly [oppose] restarting nuclear plants or expanding the use of nuclear because nuclear poses an unresolved safety, waste and environmental risk, particularly in Taiwan – a small island that can’t afford a nuclear and environmental disaster,” Chang told Al Jazeera. Chang said the chip industry should have to contribute to the cost of switching to renewable energy sources. “They should be responsible for meeting their own green energy demand, instead of leaving all the work to Taipower, as any of the money to build more energy plants and storage facilities ultimately comes from people’s tax money,” she said. Chao agreed, saying chip giants such as TSMC should lead the push to go green. “The chipmaking industry is here to stay … Sure, energy supply will be tight in the next three years, but it’s still enough,” he said.

A guesthouse in Japan says it is under pressure from local authorities to change a policy asking guests to declare that they have never committed war crimes, following complaints by Israel’s ambassador. Israeli Ambassador Gilad Cohen has accused the WIND VILLA guest house in Kyoto of discrimination following an incident in April in which an Israeli tourist was asked to sign a pledge stating he had never “been involved in any war crimes that violate humanitarian and international law”. In a post on X over the weekend, Cohen described the request as a “blatant act of discrimination against Israeli citizens and an unacceptable attempt to equate them with war criminals”. “I call on the Kyoto City authorities to address this case swiftly,” Cohen said. “We trust that the Japanese authorities will continue to uphold the values of hospitality and respect that Japan is so well known for – and ensure all visitors feel welcome and safe.” Deeply concerned by the discriminatory incident that took place in April at Wind Villa guesthouse in Kyoto, where an Israeli tourist was asked to sign a declaration stating he had not committed war crimes. This is a blatant act of discrimination against Israeli citizens and an… — Gilad Cohen 🇮🇱🎗️ (@GiladCohen_) May 10, 2025  WIND VILLA owner Ace Kishi said in an interview that he has no plans to change the policy following an investigation by Kyoto city authorities and a rebuke from the Israeli envoy. Kishi said he began asking guests to sign the pledge about six months ago in response to world events. “I was really concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Israeli attacks on Gaza,” Kishi told Al Jazeera. “I just wanted to take some measures for our safety, and for guest safety, as well, and to express our disagreement with war crimes and international violations.” Kishi said only four people have signed the pledge so far – three Israelis and one Russian. The Israeli tourist in April was the first to take issue with the request, he said, although some guests were surprised by the document. “Mostly, they have had no objection, they just looked a little confused,” Kishi said. “The last one was quite confused and upset. But eventually he signed and said he hadn’t committed any war crimes.” In an account of his interaction with the Israeli tourist posted on X last month, Kishi described the man as an otherwise pleasant guest and admitted to feeling a “little sorry for him”. “The pledge thing made us pretty awkward, but he still greeted me every time we met,” Kishi wrote. “He even held the door open for me while I was carrying my luggage. But he believed that what Israel was doing was absolutely right and thought that I was brainwashed for criticising it.” Given the number of troops deployed in Gaza, the number of casualties there, and the number of Israeli travelers abroad, it is statistically undeniable that those who have committed war crimes are walking freely in major cities and tourist destinations in the world. — Guesthouse WIND VILLA (@WindVilla) May 1, 2025  The Israeli tourist, who has not been named, shared a similar version of events with an Israeli news outlet following his trip to Kyoto – although the Israeli report suggested the pledge was a “condition for check-in”. “In the end, I decided to sign it because I have nothing to hide,” the guest was quoted as telling Ynet News, which said the tourist had served as a combat medic in the navy reserves. “The statement is true – I did not commit any war crimes, and Israeli soldiers do not commit war crimes. I signed because I didn’t want to create problems, and because this form means nothing,” he was quoted as saying. Following complaints from Cohen and the Israeli embassy, Kyoto tourism authorities visited the guest house several times to carry out an investigation, Kishi said. “At least the authorities, both from the city and the Japanese government, don’t think it’s a violation of the Hotel Act,” Kishi said, referring to the Japanese law governing public accommodations. “They are just expressing their concerns and trying to convince us to change our measures. But it’s beyond their authority, so it’s very indirect.” Kishi said he has tweaked the wording of the pledge to state that it would not affect guests’ eligibility to stay at WIND VILLA, to avoid further incidents. He also clarified in a public letter to Cohen that the pledge requires “all guests whom our guesthouse identifies as potentially having been involved in war crimes to sign the form,” including those from Burundi, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Mali, Myanmar, Palestine, Russia, Syria, and Sudan. Booking.com has suspended WIND VILLA’s account since the April incident, although the Israeli guest used rival site Expedia.com to book his stay, according to Kishi. On April 28, our guesthouse was suddenly suspended by https://t.co/ALza8eLJ8e without any prior inquiry, just three days after receiving a letter from the Israeli Ambassador.However, the Israeli guest in question had used a different booking site, not https://t.co/ALza8eLJ8e. pic.twitter.com/t9Z2OJ3ghF — Guesthouse WIND VILLA (@WindVilla) May 1, 2025  WIND VILLA’s other accounts on booking sites, including Expedia.com, continue to operate as normal, Kishi said. The Kyoto government and Israel’s embassy in Tokyo did not reply to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment. The Japan Times quoted a city official as saying WIND VILLA had not violated Japanese law, but the pledge was “inappropriate”. Booking.com told Al Jazeera that the company’s mission “is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world, and we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind”. “We have temporarily suspended this property so that we can investigate the matter further,” the spokesperson said. The WIND VILLA incident follows a similar occurrence in Kyoto last year, when a local hotel refused an Israeli man accommodation over his potential ties to Israel’s actions in Gaza. The Kyoto hotel in question received verbal and written warnings from the city that it had acted illegally, according to Japan’s Kyodo News. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa told local media at the time that it was “unacceptable” for any hotel to refuse accommodation because of a guest’s nationality. “We hope all visitors to Japan will be able to engage in various activities in Japan, feeling secure,” she told a news conference.

The arrests of Ben Cohen and the other protestors on Wednesday came as US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr was giving testimony to lawmakers on his shake-up of federal health agencies. “Congress kills poor kids in Gaza by buying bombs and pays for it by kicking kids off Medicaid in the US,” Cohen said as he was escorted away by police. The seven were arrested on charges of “crowding, obstructing or incommoding”, assault of a police officer or resisting arrest, US Capitol Police said in a statement. Police said Cohen was only charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding, a misdemeanor punishable by 90 days in jail, a $500 fine, or both. Cohen and his Ben & Jerry’s cofounder Jerry Greenfield are well known for their progressive activism, including opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. In an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson earlier this month, Cohen, who is Jewish, said the US had a “strange relationship” with Israel that involved Washington “supplying weapons for its genocide”. “Right now, what it means to be American is that we are the world’s largest arms exporter, we have the largest military in the world, we support the slaughter of people in Gaza,” Cohen said. “If somebody protests the slaughter of people in Gaza, we arrest them. What does our country stand for?” In 2021, Ben & Jerry’s announced that it would no longer allow its Israeli licensee to sell its ice cream in the West Bank and Gaza, saying that doing so would be “inconsistent with our values”. A US judge the following year rejected Ben & Jerry’s bid for an injunction to block the sales after finding that the company had failed to show that it would suffer irreparable harm. Ben & Jerry’s, which was founded in 1978 in the US state of Vermont, and its parent company, Unilever, later settled their legal dispute on undisclosed terms. In March, Ben & Jerry’s filed a lawsuit accusing Unilever of firing chief executive David Stever over his support for the brand’s “social mission”. More than 51,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war, following Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attacks on the country.

"economy","Qatar Airways inks 96B Boeing jet deal during Trump visit","14 May 2025",NA,"White House says agreements signed by the US and Qatar would lead to an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion. State-owned airline Qatar Airways has signed an agreement to buy 210 aircraft from United States manufacturer Boeing, coinciding with President Donald Trump’s visit to Qatar as part of his tour of the Gulf region. Trump and Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, witnessed the signing ceremony in Doha on Wednesday. The White House said that the deal for the Boeing 777X and 787 planes with GE Aerospace engines was worth $96bn. Trump said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who signed the deal with Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer next to Trump and the emir, told him: “It’s the largest order of jets in the history of Boeing. That’s good.” Trump had initially said that the deal was worth more than $200bn and was for 160 planes, before the White House issued updated numbers after his comments.     The White House also said that agreements signed by the US and Qatar would “generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion”. “This is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,” Qatar Airways Group CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement. “After two consecutive years of record-breaking commercial performance and with this historic Boeing aircraft order – we’re not simply chasing scale; we’re building strength that will allow us to continue to deliver our unmatched products and customer experiences.” The sale is also a boost for Boeing and its biggest engine supplier at a time when large versions of rival Airbus’ A350, powered by Rolls-Royce engines, have struggled with maintenance problems from operating in the world’s hottest climates, including the Gulf region. Boeing shares rose 0.9 percent in New York, while GE Aerospace stock edged up 0.1 percent. For the 787s, Qatar opted for GE Aerospace’s GEnx engines rather than Rolls-Royce’s Trent 1000, according to the administration. GE Aerospace’s GE9X is the only engine option for the 777X. It is the largest widebody engine deal for GE Aerospace, the company’s CEO Larry Culp said in a statement. Faisal al-Mudahka, editor-in-chief of the Gulf Times, said the Qatar Airways purchase of Boeing aircraft is a “win-win”. As one of the world’s top airlines with a growing market, Qatar Airways has more demand than supply at the moment and will need the fleet, he said. “I think Donald Trump and Qatar know how to package things to make political gains and economic gains.” Trump’s Qatar visit is the second destination of his Gulf tour, after an initial stop in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he made a surprise announcement about lifting sanctions on Syria and then met the country’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa. Trump is to land on a third and final stop in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday for a one-day visit. The Qatari emir said the two leaders had a “great” few hours of discussion covering a range of issues. “I think after signing these documents, we are going to another level of relations,” he said. Trump thanked the emir and said it had been a “very interesting couple of hours” discussing topics including the Russia-Ukraine war, Iran and trade relations. However, Israel’s war on Gaza was not mentioned by either leader. Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said the fact that Gaza wasn’t mentioned led him to believe the discussion is “ongoing”. “When it comes to Gaza, you have the Israelis there as well. On the issue of a ceasefire, Trump can put pressure on the Israelis, … but you still have the Israelis there making decisions. This is going to be a little bit more difficult to work out,” he told Al Jazeera. US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was also in Doha, said “we’re making progress” in response to a question by Al Jazeera Diplomatic Editor James Bays on whether discussions on Gaza were ongoing. “His tone was pretty telling. He was very positive,” Bays said. “When I asked him whether that was regarding aid deliveries or a ceasefire, he said, ‘We’re making progress on all fronts.'” “He said he hopes there would be a positive announcement ‘soon’, but we have no indication of what that might mean,” Bays added.

A former food delivery driver pleaded guilty to conspiring to steal more than $2.5m from the food delivery service DoorDash. Sayee Chaitanya Reddy Devagiri pleaded guilty on Tuesday in a federal court in San Jose, California, to a single count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, the US Attorney’s Office said. Devagiri and his co-conspirators would get the company to pay for deliveries that never occurred, federal prosecutors said. Devagiri, 30, of Newport Beach, California, admitted to working with three others in 2020 and 2021 to defraud the San Francisco-based delivery company, federal prosecutors said. The other three were indicted by a federal grand jury in August. Prosecutors said Devagiri used customer accounts to place high-value orders and then used an employee’s credentials to gain access to DoorDash software and manually reassign the orders to driver accounts that he and others controlled. He then caused the fraudulent driver accounts to report that the orders had been delivered when they had not and manipulated DoorDash’s computer systems to pay the fraudulent driver accounts for the nonexistent deliveries, officials said. Devagiri would then use DoorDash software to change the orders from “delivered” status to “in process” status and manually reassign the orders to driver accounts he and others controlled, beginning the process again, prosecutors said. Devagiri is the third defendant to plead guilty to having a role in this conspiracy. Two co-defendants previously entered pleas to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, authorities said. Manaswi Mandadapu pleaded guilty this month, and Tyler Thomas Bottenhorn pleaded guilty in November 2023. Bottenhorn was charged separately. Devagiri faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. He is scheduled to return to court on September 16.

"economy","Key takeaways from day two of Donald Trump’s Middle East tour in Qatar","14 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","Trump was the first US president to make an official state visit to Qatar, and the stop culminated in a multibillion-dollar trade deal. Donald Trump has continued his tour of the Middle East with a stop in Qatar, marking the first time a United States president has made an official state visit to the Gulf country. But just before he boarded Air Force One to fly into the Qatari capital of Doha, Trump made history in another way: He took his first-ever meeting with Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa. Wednesday marked the halfway point in Trump’s four-day trip, which included an opening stop in Saudi Arabia and will conclude on Thursday in the United Arab Emirates. As with his other visits, Trump underscored warming relations and expanding business ties during his meetings with leaders from Syria and Qatar. But back home in the US, the Democratic Party raised concerns about how the Republican leader’s personal interests might be guiding his closed-door conversations. Here are five key takeaways from Wednesday’s meetings and stops. Before setting off for Qatar, Trump took one of the most highly anticipated meetings of his entire trip: a sit-down with Syrian President al-Sharaa. It was the first time in nearly a quarter century that the top leaders from Syria and the US met face to face. And the meeting was extraordinary for a number of reasons: Until December, the US had offered a $10m reward for al-Sharaa’s capture. It continues to list Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the armed group al-Sharaa led during Syria’s civil war, as a “foreign terrorist organisation”, due to its past ties with al-Qaeda. But since a coalition led by HTS toppled the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, the US has been reevaluating its relationship with the group and its leadership. The toppling of al-Assad’s government brought an end to Syria’s nearly 13-year-long civil war, and al-Assad — long accused of human rights abuses — fled to Russia. In the lead-up to Wednesday’s meeting with al-Sharaa, Trump announced that he would lift the sanctions against Syria put in place during al-Assad’s leadership, a development that al-Sharaa’s government praised as an economic boon and a step towards stability. On Wednesday, al-Sharaa joined Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman for an in-person meeting, while Turkiye’s President Recep Erdogan joined by phone. Trump “told President Al-Sharaa that he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country”, according to a read-out from the White House. He also encouraged Syria to expel “foreign terrorists” and “Palestinian terrorists” from its borders, as well as normalise relations with Israel. The read-out added that al-Sharaa said he shared the US’s interests in “countering terrorism and eliminating chemical weapons”. He also encouraged the US to invest in Syria’s petroleum sector. Later, as he boarded Air Force One for Qatar, reporters asked Trump to share his first impressions of al-Sharaa. “Great. I think very good. Young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter. He’s got a real shot at pulling it together,” Trump replied. Pomp and circumstance have greeted Trump throughout his Middle East trip so far, and his arrival in Qatar was no exception. Even before Air Force One touched down in the Qatari capital of Doha, the pageantry of the visit — Trump’s first international tour of his second term — was on full display. As he entered Qatar’s airspace, White House Communications Adviser Margo Martin posted video online of F-15 fighter jets on either side of Air Force One, “providing honorary escort” to the president. A red carpet greeted Trump as he touched down in Qatar. The country’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was on hand to welcome him. And a ceremonial guard, riding atop white horses and camels, trotted alongside his motorcade as he was transported to the site of his state visit. “We’re extremely honoured to have you here. We’re very excited, very happy. It’s a historic visit,” Al Thani said. “I don’t know if you know that you’re the first American president to officially visit Qatar. So we’re very honoured.” Al Jazeera’s White House correspondent Kimberly Halkett, who has been following the US president’s journey, said the opulence of Trump’s tour so far has been a selling point to his domestic audiences. “ Americans loved the pomp and pageantry. They found it interesting to see the state dinner with the camels and to see some of the tea and coffee ceremonies,” Halkett said. Even Trump marvelled at the decor inside the Amiri Diwan, the government centre of Qatar, calling the marble “perfect-o”. Trump’s White House has described the president as the “dealmaker in chief”, and each stop so far on his four-day tour has culminated in the announcement of a major business deal with the US. Wednesday’s visit to Qatar was no exception. The White House announced that the US and Qatar had inked deals worth at least $1.2 trillion, including a major transaction which would see Qatar Airways buy 210 aircraft from the US company Boeing. That deal alone was worth $96bn, according to a government fact sheet. Still, that was an adjustment downward from a higher figure Trump mentioned during the trip, $200bn. “It’s the largest order of jets in the history of Boeing. That’s pretty good,” Trump said as he signed documents alongside Emir Al Thani. In a gesture to his fellow leader, Trump added: “ We’ve been friends for a long time, long before politics.” Other parts of the deal included purchases of drone and anti-drone technology from US defence companies like Raytheon and investments in the US energy sector. “I think, after signing these documents, we are going to another level of relationship between Qatar and the United States,” Al Thani said, thanking Trump. While Trump emphasised his warm relationships with Gulf allies like Qatar, he offered more pointed remarks to another powerful force in the region: Iran. Since April 12, the US has engaged with near-weekly negotiations with Iran, the most recent of which took place last weekend in Oman. The subject of the talks has been curtailing Iran’s nuclear programme. Trump has insisted he would like to prevent Iran from ever acquiring a nuclear weapon, though the government in Tehran has long denied any such ambition. Speaking at a state dinner in Qatar’s Lusail Palace, Trump put pressure on Iran to bring the negotiations to a close. “They have to get moving,” Trump said from his podium at the end of the table. “We want to see Iran thrive, do well, be successful, be happy. I know many Iranians living in New York and Washington, DC. They’re great people. And we want to have this end peacefully, not horribly,” he added. While Trump has repeatedly signalled optimism that a deal can be reached, he did hint that tensions between Iran, the US and countries like Israel could spiral out of control. “It’s a perilous situation, and we want to do the right thing,” Trump said. “We want to do something that’s going to save maybe millions of lives.” During his first term, Trump pulled the US out of a 2015 deal that gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for limiting its nuclear programme. Back in the US, Trump’s stop in Qatar continued to raise eyebrows among his critics, particularly in the Democratic Party. The weekend before his trip, Trump faced controversy over reports that his Department of Defence would accept a luxury Boeing jet worth $400m from Qatar, dubbed a “palace in the sky”. Such a gift would have been one of the largest in the history of the presidency. And critics warned it raised ethical and legal concerns, given the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the federal government from accepting gifts from foreign governments without prior approval from Congress. Still, Trump defended the idea on social media. He called the plane a “GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE” that was made “in a very public and transparent transaction”. He also walked back media reports that he would use the aircraft as personal transport after leaving office. Sources indicated the plane was likely to be decommissioned after Trump left office and sent to his presidential library. Ultimately, in Wednesday’s meeting with Emir Al Thani, the jet was not mentioned. It is unclear whether the exchange will continue. The Democratic National Committee nevertheless announced it planned to fly a banner over Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida to coincide with his Qatar visit, emblazoned with the phrase “Qatar-a-Lago”. Journalists on Air Force One pressed the president about another potential conflict of interest. One reporter asked Trump about a deal that would see an investment firm in the United Arab Emirates — the next stop on his tour — buy large sums of cryptocurrency from a company run by his family. The deal is reportedly worth $2bn. “I really don’t know anything about it,” Trump replied. “But I’m a big crypto fan. I will tell you, I’ve been that from the beginning, right from the campaign. I’m a believer in crypto.” Trump is scheduled to travel to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, before returning to the US on Friday.

"economy","Trump administration cuts another $450m in Harvard grants in escalating row","14 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","The cuts come in addition to $2.2bn in suspended contracts and grants, as the US president seeks to pressure the Ivy League school. The administration of United States President Donald Trump has slashed another $450m in grants from Harvard University, amid an ongoing feud over anti-Semitism, presidential control and the limits of academic freedom. On Tuesday, a joint task force assembled under Trump accused Harvard, the country’s oldest university, of perpetrating a “long-standing policy and practice of discriminating on the basis of race”. “Harvard’s campus, once a symbol of academic prestige, has become a breeding ground for virtue signaling and discrimination. This is not leadership; it is cowardice. And it’s not academic freedom; it’s institutional disenfranchisement,” the task force said in a statement. “By prioritizing appeasement over accountability, institutional leaders have forfeited the school’s claim to taxpayer support.” The elimination of another $450m in grants came in addition to the more than $2.2bn in federal funds that were already suspended last week, the task force added. The feud between the president and Harvard – a prestigious Ivy League campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts – began in March, when Trump sought to impose new rules and regulations on top schools that had played host to pro-Palestinian protests over the last year. Trump has called such protests “illegal” and accused participants of anti-Semitism. But student protest leaders have described their actions as a peaceful response to Israel’s war in Gaza, which has elicited concerns about human rights abuses, including genocide.    Columbia University was initially a centrepiece of the Trump administration’s efforts. The New York City school had seen the first major Palestine solidarity encampment rise on its lawn, which served as a blueprint for similar protests around the world. It also saw a series of mass arrests in the aftermath. In March, one of Columbia’s protest leaders, Mahmoud Khalil, was the first foreign student to be arrested and have his legal immigration status revoked under Trump’s campaign to punish demonstrators. And when Trump threatened to yank $400m in grants and research contracts, the school agreed to submit to a list of demands to restore the funding. The demands included adopting a formal definition of anti-Semitism, beefing up campus security and putting one of its academic departments – focused on Middle East, African and South Asian studies – under the supervision of an outside authority. Free speech advocates called Columbia’s concessions a capitulation to Trump, who they say has sought to erode academic freedom and silence viewpoints he disagrees with. On April 11, his administration issued another list of demands for Harvard that went even further. Under its terms, Harvard would have had to revamp its disciplinary system, eliminate its diversity initiatives and agree to an external audit of programmes deemed anti-Semitic. The demands also required Harvard to agree to “structural and personnel changes” that would foster “viewpoint diversity” – a term left ambiguous. But critics argued it was a means for Trump to impose his values and priorities on the school by shaping its hiring and admissions practices. Harvard has been at the centre of controversies surrounding its admissions in the past. In 2023, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled that Harvard’s consideration of race in student admissions – through a process called affirmative action – violated the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. Tuesday’s letter referenced that court decision in arguing that “Harvard University has repeatedly failed to confront the pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment plaguing its campus”. A pair of reports in April, created by Harvard University’s own task forces, also found that there were cases of anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish violence on campus in the wake of Israel’s war in Gaza, a divisive issue in US politics.    Ultimately, on April 14, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, rejected the Trump administration’s demands, arguing they were evidence of government overreach. “No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber wrote in his response. But Trump has continued to pressure the campus, including by threatening to revoke its tax-exempt status. Democrats and other critics have warned that it would be illegal for the president to influence the decisions of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with regard to individual taxpayers, like the university. Under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has also threatened to bar foreign students from enrolling at the university if Harvard did not hand over documents pertaining to the pro-Palestine protests. On Monday, Garber, Harvard’s president, wrote a response to Trump’s secretary of education, Linda McMahon, defending his campus’s commitment to free speech while also addressing the spectre of anti-Semitism. “We share common ground on a number of critical issues, including the importance of ending antisemitism and other bigotry on campus. Like you, I believe that Harvard must foster an academic environment that encourages freedom of thought and expression, and that we should embrace a multiplicity of viewpoints,” his letter read. But, he added, Harvard’s efforts to create a more equitable learning environment were “undermined and threatened” by the Trump administration’s “overreach”. “Harvard will not surrender its core, legally-protected principles out of fear of unfounded retaliation by the federal government,” Garber said. “I must refute your claim that Harvard is a partisan institution. It is neither Republican nor Democratic. It is not an arm of any other political party or movement. Nor will it ever be.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/trump-administration-cuts-another-450m-in-harvard-grants-in-escalating-row"
"economy","US and Saudi Arabia agree to $142bn weapons sale during Trump visit","13 May 2025",NA,"The White House says an agreement with Saudi Arabia includes investments in weapons and technology totaling $600bn. The administration of United States President Donald Trump says that Saudi Arabia will invest $600bn in the United States, including through technology partnerships and a weapons sales agreement worth $142bn. A fact sheet shared by the White House on Tuesday explains that the agreement, which also includes collaboration in areas such as energy and mineral development, is the largest-ever weapons sale between the two countries. “The deals celebrated today are historic and transformative for both countries and represent a new golden era of partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia,” the fact sheet reads. The pact represents a deepening of economic and military ties between the two countries, a trend that has continued for decades under both Republican and Democratic US presidents.    Trump was in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Tuesday as part of a Middle East tour, marking the first major international trip of his second term as president. Later in the week, he is expected to make stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. But already, the trip has renewed criticisms that Trump may use the diplomatic outing to advance personal interests. The proposed transfer of a $400m luxury aeroplane, for instance, from Qatar to the US Department of Defence has raised questions in the US about the ethics and constitutionality of accepting gifts from foreign governments. During his first term as president, in 2017, Trump likewise included Saudi Arabia on his first major trip abroad, a voyage that similarly culminated in a multibillion-dollar arms deal. But the global outcry over the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a consulate in Istanbul briefly threatened to upend the relationship. The US government has alleged that forces linked to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman were responsible for the killing. Tuesday’s agreement is designed to help modernise the Saudi military with “state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen US defense firms”, according to the White House fact sheet. “The first key component of this is upgrading the defence capabilities of Saudi Arabia,” Al Jazeera correspondent Hashem Ahelbarra reported from Riyadh. “This is a country that has been trying to invest vast amounts of money over the last few years” in its military, he added. But the newly minted deal is not limited to security cooperation. The agreement also lays out a plan in which Saudi Arabia will invest $20bn in energy infrastructure and data centres for artificial intelligence in the US, a significant infusion of cash into industries with close ties to the Trump administration. In both areas, US companies stand to reap a potential windfall. “Saudi Arabia wants to become one of the top global investors in artificial intelligence, and that’s why you see many tech CEOs here in Riyadh, who are looking forward to getting some of those contracts,” said Ahelbarra. The deal also includes references to collaboration on energy infrastructure and mineral investments, without offering many details.    Various US administrations, including during Trump’s first term in office, have used the inducement of greater collaboration on security and arms sales to push Saudi Arabia to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel. The two countries have never had formal diplomatic ties. But during Trump’s first term, the Republican leader initiated a series of agreements known as the Abraham Accords to boost ties between Israel and various Middle East states. Countries like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan agreed to recognise Israel as part of the agreements. But Saudi Arabia has been a holdout — and normalising ties between it and Israel could be seen as a crowning achievement for the second Trump administration. Israel’s war in Gaza, however, has complicated those efforts. United Nations experts have warned that Israel’s actions in Gaza were consistent with genocide, and South Africa has accused Israel of genocide before the International Court of Justice. The International Criminal Court, meanwhile, has issued arrest warrants for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant over accusations of war crimes. The spiralling death toll in Gaza and allegations of human rights abuses have caused outrage in the region and hardened Riyadh’s insistence that normalisation should come only as part of a wider agreement on a Palestinian state, a move Israel is not willing to consider.

"economy","US decision to lift sanctions on Syria: Here’s what you need to know","13 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia that he would lift sanctions on Syria. United States President Donald Trump has announced that US sanctions on Syria will be lifted, in a huge boost to the government in Damascus, which took power after the overthrow of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December. “There’s a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilising the country and keeping peace,” Trump said in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, the first of a three-day visit to the Middle East, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness.” Trump is also expected to meet Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Riyadh on Wednesday, in a further signal to the world that the international isolation of Syria should end. In Syria, the news has been met with celebrations in the capital, Damascus, and elsewhere. There is hope the move will help turn around the country’s economy after more than a decade of war. Let’s take a closer look. The US was just one of many countries that had placed sanctions on Syria during the former al-Assad regime, which governed the country from 1971 to 2024.    The US sanctions were wide-ranging. The US initially designated Syria a “State Sponsor of Terrorism” in 1979, which led to an arms embargo and financial restrictions, including on foreign assistance. Further sanctions were imposed in 2004, including more arms export restrictions and limits on Syria’s economic interactions with the US. After the war in Syria began in 2011, and al-Assad’s regime started attacking civilian antigovernment protesters, numerous other wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Syria and regime-linked individuals. This included a freeze on Syrian government assets held abroad, a ban on US investments in Syria and restrictions on petroleum imports. The US had also announced a $10m reward for the capture of Syria’s current leader, al-Sharaa, and listed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the organisation he ran before its dissolution with the fall of al-Assad, as a “Foreign Terrorist Organization”. The main tranche of sanctions was imposed during the early years of Syria’s war, when the US was supporting the country’s opposition and attempting to isolate the al-Assad regime, pointing to its human rights abuses, including the use of chemical weapons. The “terrorist” designation placed on Hayat Tahrir al-Sham was a result of its former association with al-Qaeda. This was one of the reasons there has been international wariness to remove sanctions on Syria even after the fall of al-Assad. Al-Sharaa has slowly been gaining international legitimacy for his government since it came to power in December. The US had already removed the reward for his capture, and the Syrian president has been able to travel internationally and meet world leaders, including in Saudi Arabia and France. The new Syrian government has made a concerted effort to present itself as a moderate force that could be acceptable to the international community, including by distancing itself from designated “terrorist” groups, promising to cooperate with other countries on “counterterrorism” efforts and making statements supporting minority rights. The latter has been particularly important in light of sectarian fighting involving pro-government forces and minority groups after the fall of al-Assad. The Reuters news agency also reported this week that Syria has attempted to convince the US that it is not a threat but a potential partner, including by saying it was engaged in indirect talks with Israel to deescalate tensions with the US’s Middle eastern ally – despite Israel’s bombing of Syria and occupation of its territory. There had also been talk of US-Syria business deals, even including a Trump Tower in Damascus.    Trump on Tuesday said that his decision to end the sanctions came after discussions with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “Oh, what I do for the crown prince!” he said. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said that US relationships with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE – all countries that had been pushing for an end to sanctions and support for the new Syrian government – had been an integral part of Trump’s decision. “This wasn’t something that was too difficult for Trump to do,” Rahman said. “He didn’t need to get permission from anybody. He didn’t even need consent from Congress.”    Because of the central role the US plays in the global financial system, the lifting of sanctions is a signal to the world that it can do business in Syria. The sanctions had been economically debilitating for Syria, and presented a huge impediment for the new government, which is under pressure to improve living standards in a country where unemployment and poverty levels are high, and electricity blackouts are common. Whether the US itself invests in Syria remains to be seen, but increased Arab and Turkish investment is likely. “[The removal of sanctions] takes away a key obstacle in [Syria’s] ability to establish some kind of economic development, economic prosperity,” Rahman told Al Jazeera. “But there are plenty of other obstacles and challenges the country is facing.”             Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/us-decision-to-lift-sanctions-on-syria-heres-what-you-need-to-know"
"economy","Why did the US and China slash tariffs – and what’s next?","13 May 2025","Sarah Shamim","Experts say the pullback on tariffs shows that China managed to stand its ground, as Trump battled domestic pressure. The United States and China reached a deal on Monday to suspend heavy tariffs against each other’s imports for 90 days. The recent breakthrough marked a detente in the tariff war launched by US President Donald Trump since he returned to office in January. While Trump initially unveiled tariffs against most countries, he then paused most of them – except against China, the US’s biggest economic rival. Tit-for-tat tariffs that the US and China imposed on each other had snowballed into heavy duties, as high as 145 percent on Chinese goods looking to enter the US, and 125 percent on US products looking to access the Chinese market. On Monday, Trump said he could speak with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping by the end of the week, adding that the economic negotiations had led to a “reset” between the two countries. The US and China released a joint statement on Monday announcing the suspension of tariffs. The suspension came after two days of trade talks in Geneva, Switzerland. In recent weeks,  Trump had repeatedly said tariff talks with China were under way, but officials in Beijing had denied any ongoing negotiations before the meetings in Geneva. In the statement on Monday, the two countries said they recognise the importance of their “bilateral economic and trade relationship” as well as the importance of a “sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship”. The statement said both nations would take steps to suspend most tariffs by Wednesday. The US brought down the tariff on Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China brought down the tariff on the US from 125 percent to 10 percent. On April 2, the US had imposed a “reciprocal tariff” of 34 percent on Chinese goods, on top of 20 percent tariffs that Trump had previously imposed on Chinese products since starting his current term. Those earlier tariffs were driven by Trump’s accusation that China was to blame for the fentanyl crisis that has ravaged thousands of American lives and led to several deaths in the US. In effect, on April 2, Chinese goods were tariffed at 54 percent. Beijing hit back with a 34 percent tariff on imports from the US. What followed was a tit-for-tat escalation, where the US and China kept hiking tariffs against each other. At the end, the US had imposed a 145 percent tariff on China while China had imposed a 125 percent tariff on the US. On May 12, they both agreed to slash all tariffs imposed on April 2 and subsequently to 10 percent. But if pre-April 2 tariffs are accounted for, Chinese goods still face a 30 percent tariff. Additionally, specific products from China, such as electric vehicles, steel and aluminium, are subject to even higher, separate tariffs imposed in recent years. All the tariff suspensions are only for 90 days as of now – subject to review based on broader trade negotiations between the US and China. The US and China agreed, per their joint statement, to establish a mechanism to continue talking about their trade relations. “This move is significant primarily because it reflects a strategic retreat by the US, rather than a genuine shift in the broader trajectory of US-China relations,” Carlos Lopes, a Chatham House associate fellow for the Africa Programme, told Al Jazeera. Lopes, whose areas of expertise include international trade and China, explained that the rolling back of tariffs underscores that China held its ground, compelling the US to revise its approach. “In that sense, the rollback signals the limits of grandstanding and unilateralism in a deeply interconnected global economy. It’s a tactical pause, not a strategic realignment.” “The reversal is a recognition of domestic economic pressures,” Lopes said. He added that the tariffs were raising prices for American consumers and undermining key manufacturing sectors, particularly those reliant on Chinese intermediate goods. “The US economy, despite its scale, cannot isolate itself from global supply chains without serious collateral damage. Moreover, President Trump thrives on projecting strength through negotiation – but bargaining without structure or a clear endgame eventually reveals weakness. The rollback reflects this internal contradiction,” he said. Fentanyl – and China’s role in the supply chain of the deadly synthetic opioid – was never the major factor behind Trump’s tariffs against Beijing, Lopes said. “Fentanyl was part of the public discourse but not a fundamental driver of the tariff decision. It served more as a symbolic issue for political messaging, particularly to domestic audiences. The core dynamics at play here are structural – supply chain interdependence, inflationary concerns, and electoral calculations – not drug policy,” the Chatham House analyst said. In the statement, both countries named representatives for negotiations. Vice Premier of the State Council He Lifeng has been named to represent China. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer have been named to represent the US. The Monday announcement caused stocks and the dollar to see a surge. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 gained 184.28 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1,161 points and the Nasdaq composite gained 779.43 points. The euro went down by 1.5 percent at $1.1078. The yen weakened and the US currency shot up 2.1 percent at 148.49. In the wake of Trump’s tariff threats, global markets had seen a considerable fall. The world’s two largest economies, the US and China, have both long competed for economic preeminence and relied on each other as major trading partners. The US is China’s largest export market, constituting 12.9 percent of Chinese exports in 2023, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). China is the US’s third-largest export market, behind Canada and Mexico. Chinese goods made up 14.8 percent of the US’s total imports in 2023. That trade provides US consumers with affordable products and allows US companies to earn billions of dollars annually from sales in China. China gains billions of dollars in exports and millions of jobs from this trade relationship. Analysts at the US financial services company Goldman Sachs estimated that if the US continued its trade war with China, up to 16 million jobs in China could be at risk. But, in the US, there have also been growing calls for a reevaluation of that economic relationship. During his first term, Trump waged a “trade war” on China, seeking to balance the trade deficit the US had with the country. In 2024, the US had a $295.4bn trade deficit with China – the largest trade deficit than any trading partner. While the Chinese leadership has consistently argued that the trade war does not benefit anyone, former US President Joe Biden continued several of Trump’s tariffs and added to them. Other concerns about the trade relationship flagged by analysts, including at the Council on Foreign Relations, include worries of manufacturing job losses in the US and fears of Chinese espionage and intellectual property theft. As a result, successive US administrations have increased the scrutiny of exports to China to prevent sensitive US technology from reaching the Chinese military. The US Congress passed a law in 2018 allowing the president to control US exports that were perceived as “dual-use”, that is, which could be used for commercial or military purposes. China is widely viewed as a primary target of this law.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/5/13/why-did-the-us-and-china-slash-tariffs-and-whats-next"

Doha, Qatar – India’s Olympic gold medal-winning athlete Neeraj Chopra believes the recent escalations between his country and neighbouring Pakistan will affect the hugely popular friendship he shared with his cross-border counterpart Arshad Nadeem. Both men’s javelin athletes have earned widespread praise for overlooking the decades-old South Asian rivalry with their friendly interactions at international tournaments, but Chopra said on Thursday that his relationship with Nadeem is unlikely to remain the same. India and Pakistan were involved in a brief but intense military confrontation last week that threatened to erupt into the fifth full-scale war between the two countries. “It will not be like it was before [the recent escalations],” Chopra told Al Jazeera when asked about the repercussions of the tensions on his friendship with Nadeem. “I never had a very deep friendship with him, but we were always respectful towards each other,” he added while speaking before the Doha Diamond League, a World Athletics meet scheduled for Friday in Qatar. The frequent words of encouragement and appreciation exchanged between Chopra, who won Olympic gold at Tokyo 2021, and Nadeem, who bagged gold at Paris 2024, rendered both the darlings of social media and the face of a rare cross-border friendship. Happy Birthday to my friend and fellow athlete @Neeraj_chopra1 Wishing you a year filled with happiness, success, better health and joy. May you have a wonderful life ahead! — Arshad Nadeem (@ArshadOlympian1) December 24, 2024  However, following the April 22 attack that left 26 civilians dead in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, Chopra faced intense social media backlash for inviting Nadeem to the May 24 Neeraj Chopra Classic javelin event in India. The invitation was extended before the attack and was declined by Nadeem, citing his preparations for the May 27-31 Asian Athletics Championship in South Korea. Chopra’s eponymous event was eventually postponed in the wake of the cross-border conflict, but not before the 27-year-old Indian athlete released a statement on April 25, saying Nadeem’s participation at the meet was “completely out of the question” following the Pahalgam attack. pic.twitter.com/yMsX8ggnLA — Neeraj Chopra (@Neeraj_chopra1) April 25, 2025  On May 7, India launched multiple missile attacks on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and the Pakistani military claimed to have shot down multiple Indian air force planes. Three days later, Pakistan retaliated with a missile attack on Indian airbases. Both countries were on the precipice of war before a United States-brokered ceasefire was agreed. Amid the war-like scenario, both Chopra and Nadeem took to social media to pledge their support for their respective armed forces. It was in stark contrast to the warmth shared by the world’s top javelin throwers, who often posed together for photographs at athletics events and shared greetings on social media. Chopra and Nadeem were gold and silver medallists at the World Athletics Championships in 2023 and celebrated together as the Indian asked his Pakistani opponent to join him for a photo and stood close with their arms around each other. When Nadeem became the first Pakistani track and field athlete to win a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, Chopra’s mother won hearts across the border when she said Nadeem was also like a “son” to her. It is unclear when the athletes will compete against each other, as Nadeem is not participating at the Doha Diamond League and Chopra is set to skip the Asian Athletics Championships in South Korea. Despite the fallout of the recent political and military standoff, Chopra said he will continue to maintain a respectful demeanour towards Nadeem. “I have a lot of friends in the athletics circuit since javelin throwers are a very small community,” Chopra said. “I will always reciprocate the respect I receive from my fellow athletes.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/15/chopra-nadeem-javelin-friendship-not-the-same-after-india-pakistan-clash"

Tadeo Allende scored twice and Inter Miami tied the San Jose Earthquakes 3-3 in Lionel Messi’s first game in the Bay Area since joining MLS. Allende scored once in the first half and then tied the game in the 52nd minute on Wednesday night when he tapped in a pass from Baltasar Rodríguez on a play that Messi helped set up. Maximiliano Falcon also scored for Miami, which has allowed at least three goals in three of the last four games. Cristian Arango, Beau Leroux and Ian Harkes scored for the Earthquakes, who are unbeaten in their last three games. Messi had a chance late for the game-winner but was stopped from in close in stoppage time in the second half by Daniel De Sousa Britto. Messi’s debut here was played in front of a sellout crowd of 18,000 with fans lined up hours before the game for the opportunity to see the Miami star in person. His entire Bay Area stay was turned into a multiday event with a block party held on Tuesday night, and fans gathered outside of Miami’s team hotel, excited just to get a wave from the balcony from Messi. Messi had a few good opportunities in the first half, barely missing wide left after getting a pass in the box in transition and then missing wide again on a free kick from just outside the box in the closing seconds of the half. The game got off to an exciting start with Miami scoring about 35 seconds into the game, following a corner kick when Falcon headed in a crosser from Jordi Alba. The Earthquakes quickly responded in the third minute with Arango converting on a pass from Cristian Espinoza about 2:05 into the game, marking just the fifth time in MLS history that both teams scored in the first three minutes of a game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The teams traded goals later in the half with Leroux giving San Jose the lead in the 37th minute and Allende answering about seven minutes later. The Earthquakes took a 3-2 lead at the half when Harkes scored with a left-footed shot from outside the box on an assist from Leroux in injury time.

The Timberwolves advanced to the conference finals, where they will await the winner of the series between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Denver Nuggets. “It’s great,” Randle said on Wednesday night. “We’ve had a season full of adversity. Coach (Chris Finch) said at the end of the regular season that we didn’t do anything as far as trades or firing coaches. We just stuck together, and we got through it together. “I’m super proud of our team, everybody that stepped up in some type of way this year. We got win No. 8 (in the playoffs). We’ve got to keep going.” Brandin Podziemski scored 28 points on 11-for-19 shooting to lead Golden State. Jonathan Kuminga added 26 points off the bench, and Jimmy Butler III chipped in 17 points and six assists. “It was a fight,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “I’m really proud of our guys. They hung in there and they battled the whole way through. “(It was) quite a turnaround in our season from where we were a few months ago to giving ourselves a chance and having a swing at the plate for some real chances to go deep. We were right there. Obviously, it didn’t go our way. The Wolves were great, they deserved it. But I’m very proud of our team.” The Warriors dropped their fourth straight game without Stephen Curry, who watched in street clothes from the bench. Curry injured his left hamstring in the series opener after leading Golden State to a first-round playoff series win over the Houston Rockets. Kerr said of the challenge of playing without Curry, “Injuries are part of the playoffs. I learned a long time ago that the playoffs are really about health and then just guys stepping up and making some big shots, big plays in key games. That’s what decides every series. “We’ve been on both ends of that. It’s just part of it. There’s no sense in dwelling on it, and I don’t want to take anything away from what Minnesota just accomplished.” The Timberwolves led by as many as 25 points late in the third quarter. Randle dribbled the ball from one end of the court to the other and finished with a running layup to give the Timberwolves a 93-68 edge with 1:01 remaining in the third. The Warriors made a determined push in the fourth quarter to cut the deficit to nine. Moses Moody drained a 3-pointer to bring Golden State within 99-90 with 7:11 to play. Edwards helped Minnesota regain a double-digit advantage moments later. He knocked down a 3-pointer to put the Timberwolves on top 102-90, and Jaden McDaniels increased the lead to 14 points with a steal and a layup with 6:36 remaining. “The team has come together at the right time and is playing its best basketball,” Finch said. The Timberwolves led 62-47 at the half. Golden State trailed 45-42 after Podziemski made a jump shot with 4:11 left in the half. Minnesota closed the second quarter on a 17-5 run to grab a 15-point lead. Randle finished the first-half scoring with a three-point play after making a layup and drawing a foul. The Timberwolves shot 62.8 percent (49 of 78) overall and 41.9 percent (13 of 31) from beyond the arc. The Warriors shot 43.3 percent (39 of 90) from the field and 28.2 percent (11 of 39) from 3-point range. In an earlier playoff fixture on Wednesday, Derrick White scored a game-high 34 points and the Boston Celtics extended their season by beating the visiting New York Knicks 127-102 in Game 5 of their Eastern Conference second-round series. The Knicks lead the best-of-seven series 3-2 heading into Friday’s Game 6 in New York. White shot 7-for-13 from 3-point territory and made nine of his 11 free-throw attempts. Boston sank 22 of its 49 shots from behind the 3-point arc (44.9 percent) and outscored New York 68-43 in the second half. The Celtics received 26 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds from Jaylen Brown. Luke Kornet added 10 points, nine rebounds and seven blocked shots and Payton Pritchard came off the bench to make five 3-pointers and score 17 points. “We made winning plays on both ends of the floor,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “They made enough plays to win. Gave us another chance to play.” It was Boston’s second playoff game without All-Star forward Jayson Tatum, who had surgery on Tuesday to repair a ruptured right Achilles tendon. Josh Hart scored a team-high 24 points for New York, which shot 29-of-81 from the field (35.8 percent). Jalen Brunson collected 22 points and six assists, but he fouled out with 7:19 to play. Brunson was called for his fifth foul with 2:45 remaining in the third quarter. “That we didn’t play for 48 minutes,” said Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau when asked what stood out on Wednesday. “We didn’t play tough with the lead. Can’t afford to do that.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/15/randle-timberwolves-eliminate-warriors-in-game-5-of-nba-playoffs"
"sports","Real Madrid keep Barcelona waiting for La Liga by beating Mallorca","14 May 2025","Kevin Hand","Defending champions Real Madrid come from behind to beat Mallorca and keep La Liga title defence alive. Jacobo Ramon scored deep into stoppage time as Real Madrid rallied to beat Mallorca 2-1 and delay Barcelona’s title celebration. Madrid needed the victory on Wednesday to keep Barcelona from clinching its 28th league title without winning another match. The Catalan club remains four points ahead and can still lift the trophy with a win at city rival Espanyol on Thursday. Mallorca took the lead with a goal by Martin Valjent in the 11th minute and stayed ahead until Kylian Mbappe beat a couple of defenders to equalise in the 68th. Ramon netted the go-ahead goal from inside the area five minutes into injury time, preventing Barcelona from winning the title, for now. Mbappe is still in the race to be the league’s leading scorer, arriving for Wednesday’s match with 27 goals, two more than Barcelona’s Robert Lewandowski. Mbappe had a hat-trick in the loss to Barcelona on Sunday. Barcelona virtually secured the title by coming from behind to beat Madrid 4-3 in Barcelona in the last “Clasico” of the season on Sunday. Madrid lost all four matches against Barcelona this season, being outscored 16-7. It was the first time Barcelona won every “Clasico” in a season that had at least three matches between the rivals. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti received a mostly indifferent reaction from the fans at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on Wednesday after taking over the Brazil job. The Italian was announced as Brazil’s new coach on Monday, and some Madrid fans criticised the coach for negotiating with the five-time champions with the La Liga season still under way. There were no significant jeers or cheers when Ancelotti’s name was announced by the loudspeakers at the Bernabeu before the match, with most fans applauding and saying his name along with the announcer, following the tradition at the stadium.

"sports","Why were Pete Rose, Shoeless Joe Jackson banned from Baseball Hall of Fame?","14 May 2025","Andrew Semple","Major League Baseball reinstates two of the sport’s great players, making them Hall of Fame eligible. Pete Rose and “Shoeless Joe” Jackson have been reinstated by Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner Rob Manfred, making both eligible for the sport’s Hall of Fame after their careers were tarnished by gambling scandals. Rose’s permanent ban was lifted on Tuesday, eight months after his death and a day before the Cincinnati Reds honour baseball’s career hits leader with Pete Rose Night. Manfred announced he was changing the league’s policy on permanent ineligibility, saying bans would expire at death. Here is all to know about the MLB lifting the ban on two of baseball’s all-time great players: Rose and Jackson were considered longstanding pariahs in Major League Baseball due to their gambling on the sport. Jackson was a member of the Chicago White Sox team that were accused of conspiring with gamblers to purposely lose the 1919 World Series. He accepted $5,000 to throw the series, which the Cincinnati Reds won. Eight players from that White Sox team, despite avoiding criminal charges, were banned from organised baseball in 1921. Rose was caught betting on games while manager of the Cincinnati Reds and was barred for life from baseball by Commissioner Bart Giamatti in 1989. Jackson’s phenomenal career batting average of .356 is the fourth highest in MLB history. Later, after he was banned from the majors, he played baseball under assumed names in southern leagues in the United States. Jackson died in 1951 but remains one of baseball’s most recognisable names in part for his depiction by actor Ray Liotta in the 1989 movie Field of Dreams. Rose set MLB career records for hits (4,256), games played (3,562) and at-bats (14,053) – among others – and finished with a .303 career batting average. He won the World Series three times, twice with the Reds and once with the Philadelphia Phillies. Rose also won three batting titles, two Gold Glove Awards, the National League Rookie of the Year and the National League Most Valuable Player. Rose died on September 30 aged 83. Rose’s supporters have included US President Donald Trump, who expressed on social media in March that he intends to pardon Rose posthumously. Trump didn’t specify what a Rose pardon would be for, but he was sentenced to five months in prison for submitting falsified tax returns in 1990. Manfred discussed Rose with Trump when the pair met in April, but he hasn’t disclosed specifics of their conversation other than they discussed Rose’s eligibility for reinstatement into the league. Was Trump’s pardon post two months earlier behind the MLB’s decision on Tuesday to lift the bans on Rose and Jackson? The MLB would point to its in-house disciplinary procedures as the only way for disgraced players to be formally reinstated into the league. Rose and Jackson won’t be eligible to come up for a vote until the Hall of Fame’s Classic Era Baseball committee meets in December 2027. The committee is responsible for voting on individuals who made their biggest impact in baseball before 1980.

"sports","Ex-Olympic cyclist Rohan Dennis gets suspended sentence over wife’s death","14 May 2025",NA,"Dennis received a 17-month suspended sentence over a car incident in Australia which killed his wife, fellow Olympian Melissa Hoskins. Former Olympic cyclist and world champion Rohan Dennis received a suspended sentence over what was termed a “tragic accident” that led to the death of his wife, fellow Olympian Melissa Hoskins. The 34-year-old appeared in South Australia District Court on Wednesday after an earlier charge of committing an aggravated act likely to cause harm. Dennis was arrested after Hoskins, 32, was struck by his vehicle in front of their home at Medindie in Adelaide’s north on December 30, 2023. Hoskins suffered serious injuries in the crash and died at Royal Adelaide Hospital. The court was told that the couple had argued over kitchen renovations before Dennis left their home and drove away. The court also heard that Hoskins had jumped onto the hood of the car during the incident. Dennis on Wednesday was sentenced to one year, four months and 28 days in jail, to be suspended for two years. The sentence was reduced from two years and two months because of his guilty plea and he’s been placed on a two-year good behaviour bond. His driver’s licence was also suspended for five years. “I accept you have a sense of responsibility for all that occurred, I accept you have anguished over what could have been different if you had acted in some other way,” Judge Ian Press said Wednesday. Dennis showed little emotion when Press sentenced him. “Given your plea of guilty, your remorse, that you are the sole carer for your young children, and given all your other personal circumstances and the circumstances of the offending, I am satisfied that good reason exists to suspend that sentence,” the judge said. The offence carried a maximum sentence of seven years in jail but lawyer Jane Abbey asked that her client receive a suspended sentence, which was not opposed by the prosecution. During sentencing submissions in April, Amanda Hoskins said her daughter had loved Dennis “and I know that you would never intentionally hurt her”. “I believe this is a tragic accident. Your temper is your downfall and needs to be addressed,” she said. Hoskins’ funeral was held in her home city of Perth, Western Australia, and a public memorial service was held in Adelaide in February 2024. Dennis attended the service with their two children. Hoskins competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics on the track in the team pursuit and was in the squad that won the 2015 world title. Dennis won two world titles in the road time trial, as well as silver in the team pursuit at the 2012 Olympics and bronze in the road time trial at the Tokyo Olympics.

Ilia Topuria will look to add a second Ultimate Fighting Championship belt to his collection when he headlines UFC 317 on June 28 – it just won’t be against Islam Makhachev. After weeks of heightened anticipation for a potential blockbuster face-off between the superstar pair, Topuria, a former undisputed featherweight champ, will now fight former champion Charles Oliveira for the vacant lightweight title, UFC CEO Dana White announced on Tuesday. Makhachev, a four-time defending champion, will vacate the lightweight belt to move up to welterweight to face newly crowned Jack Della Maddalena, who defeated Belal Muhammad last Saturday at UFC 315 to become the new title holder in the weight class. The date for that fight has yet to be announced. Topuria has a perfect UFC record of 16-0. The Spaniard relinquished his 145-pound (66kg) featherweight title earlier this year in anticipation of a lightweight title showdown against Makhachev and took to social media to voice his displeasure at the Russian vacating his title belt. “On June 29, another dream will come true,” Topuria wrote. “I’ll be the champion of the lightweight division. Charles [Oliveira], my apologies in advance… I’m just fighting for my dreams. It’s unfortunate that Makhachev ran away.” Makhachev, who sports a 27-1 UFC record, is ranked by ESPN as the best pound-for-pound UFC fighter in the world; Topuria is ranked number two.

Who: Real Madrid vs MallorcaWhat: Spanish La Liga – Match day 36Where: Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, SpainWhen: Wednesday at 9.30pm (19:30 GMT) Follow Al Jazeera Sport’s live text and photo commentary stream. Fresh from their demoralising 4-3 defeat at Barcelona in El Clasico on Sunday, Real Madrid will now face Mallorca at home at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday as they desperately try to keep their La Liga title defence alive. With three rounds to play, the championship calculus is relatively simple: Real need to keep winning and hope Barcelona, who have lost only two games in 2025 across all competitions, lose their remaining three league games. Here are the key talking points as the Spanish giants embark on their must-win Match day 36 fixture against Mallorca, who currently sit ninth on the La Liga ladder: Barcelona’s dramatic 4-3 come-from-behind victory against Real on Sunday was undoubtedly the most devastating defeat of the four El Clasico fixtures Madrid have conceded to their great rivals in the 2024-25 season. On most days, star striker Kylian Mbappe’s two goals in the opening 14 minutes of El Clasico, followed by a hat-trick in the 70th minute, would have been enough to bury any team in the Spanish top-flight – but this Barcelona side is the exception. Real Madrid now find themselves seven points behind the Catalan giants with just three rounds remaining in La Liga. The basic maths is quite straightforward: if Real lose or draw with Mallorca on Wednesday, Barcelona – even if they lost their last three matches – would win the La Liga title on a countback; if Real beat Mallorca on Wednesday and Barcelona defeat Espanyol on Thursday, then Barcelona are instantly crowned champions. Real Madrid began the season as the defending La Liga champions with lofty aspirations to complete a rare title treble: La Liga, Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League. They did win the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Intercontinental Cup this season, but lost the Supercopa and Copa del Rey finals to Barcelona, while they were eliminated from the Champions League by Arsenal at the quarterfinal stage. Real are 0-4 against Barcelona this season, having lost both La Liga fixtures as well as the aforementioned Supercopa and Copa del Rey finals. It was announced on Monday that manager Carlo Ancelotti will leave Real Madrid for a second time, despite having a year remaining on his contract, after the Italian signed on to coach Brazil before the FIFA World Cup 2026. Speculation of his departure had been in play for weeks after the 65-year-old all but admitted to the media he might leave the club after the Copa del Rey final loss to Barcelona on April 26. Also on Monday, multiple Spanish media outlets reported that former Real Madrid star midfielder – and current Bayer Leverkusen manager – Xabi Alonso is set to become the club’s next boss on a three-year deal when he leaves the German club after this season. Alonso, 43, is expected to join Real before the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup in the United States from June 15 to July 13, media reports said. In a serious blow to Real Madrid’s short-term prospects, star forward Vinicius Junior will sit out the match against Mallorca after picking up an ankle injury, following Sunday’s 4-3 loss to Barcelona. Further depleting the regular starting XI are Lucas Vazquez, who is struggling with a thigh injury, and Aurelien Tchouameni, who picked up a yellow-card suspension and will miss out on Wednesday’s crucial contest. The mysterious status of key attacking midfielder Rodrygo, who occupied a seat on the bench during El Clasico and is rumoured to be refusing to play in recent matches, was addressed by Ancelotti on Tuesday, who explained to the media why the Brazilian star will miss his third straight fixture. “Rodrygo was struck by a fever last week, which hindered his training and recovery. Today, he mentioned some thigh discomfort that requires our careful attention. Post-fever, he’s not yet in top form. Despite the swirling speculation, it’s clear that Rodrygo is cherished by everyone, especially me,” Ancelotti said. David Alaba, Eder Militao, Antonio Rudiger and Dani Carvajal all remain unavailable through injury. Manager Jagoba Arrasate is set to play Leo Roman in place of first-choice goalkeeper Dominik Greif against Real Madrid. Key midfielder Robert Navarro is anticipated to miss the match as he battles back from an injury he picked up on March 2 against Alaves. Abdon Prats, Chiquinho and Manu Morlanes are all questionable for this fixture.

Despite some key players being sidelined, we are prepared to field a formidable lineup. Our aim is to triumph in these final three games.

Andy Murray will no longer be coaching former rival Novak Djokovic, ending their six-month partnership, the pair announced. Djokovic stunned the tennis world in November when he said he had hired the retired Murray, who had no track record as a coach, to lead his off-court team. But the two 37-year-old tennis greats have already parted company, with the former British player thanking Serbian star Djokovic for an “unbelievable opportunity”. Their split comes after Djokovic, the winner of a record 24 men’s Grand Slam singles titles, endured a difficult start to the season, including losing his first match at his last two tournaments. “Thanks to Novak for the unbelievable opportunity to work together and thanks to his team for all their hard work over the past six months,” Murray said in a statement released on Tuesday. “I wish Novak all the best for the rest of the season,” added the Scot, who defeated Djokovic in the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon finals to win two of his three Grand Slam titles. Their partnership started well, with Djokovic defeating Carlos Alcaraz at the Australian Open, only to retire through injury during his semifinal against Alexander Zverev. But success has since proved elusive, with Djokovic saying on Tuesday: “Thank you, coach Andy, for all the hard work, fun and support over last six months on and off the court, really enjoyed deepening our friendship together.” Murray, who retired after the 2024 Paris Olympics, is a three-time singles Grand Slam winner and former world number one.

Jalen Brunson scored 26 of his 39 points in the second half, and the New York Knicks became the first home team to win in the series by defeating the Boston Celtics 121-113 to take a 3-1 series lead in their Eastern Conference second-round matchup. Karl-Anthony Towns added 23 points and 11 rebounds, and Mikal Bridges also scored 23 for the Knicks, who recovered from a 14-point third-quarter deficit on Monday night. OG Anunoby made some key plays late while contributing 20 points. “They hit us early, and obviously we got into a hole,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “I love the way we fought back, and we showed a lot of toughness and more discipline in the second half and timely plays. Everybody worked together on both ends of the floor.” Boston star Jayson Tatum sustained a possible serious right ankle injury late in the contest. Tatum had 42 points, eight rebounds, four assists and four steals. He knocked down seven 3-pointers for the second-seeded Celtics, who squandered 20-point leads while dropping the first two games in the series. Tatum was helped off the floor with his right foot kept in the air and was later seen being pushed to the locker room while sitting in a rolling chair. “I got back there, talked to the medical staff, and they told me it’s a lower-body injury for Jayson Tatum and we’ll get an MRI in the morning,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. Derrick White made six 3-pointers and scored 23 points, and Jaylen Brown added 20 points and seven rebounds for Boston. Payton Pritchard added 12 points off the bench. The Knicks can clinch the best-of-seven series with a win in Game 5 at Boston on Wednesday night. “It’s not like we planned to be in this situation,” White said. “But we are where we are. We have to find a way to win Game 5.” In the other playoff game on Monday, Anthony Edwards poured 11 of his 30 points into a 17-0 third-quarter flurry as the Minnesota Timberwolves moved within one win of a second consecutive berth in the Western Conference finals with a 117-110 road win over the Golden State Warriors in Game 4 in San Francisco. Julius Randle led the way with 31 points and Jaden McDaniels contributed 10 points and 13 rebounds for the sixth-seeded Timberwolves, who have rallied from a series-opening loss to win three straight from the Stephen Curry-less Warriors. Minnesota could clinch the best-of-seven series in Game 5 on Wednesday in Minneapolis. Jonathan Kuminga had a team-high 23 points for seventh-seeded Golden State, which lost Curry to a hamstring injury during its Game 1 win. The Warriors previously announced that their standout point guard would be re-evaluated before Game 5, with the possibility of Curry returning at that point. Golden State held a 60-58 halftime lead, and the game was tied 68-all in the fourth minute of the third period before Edwards turned a floater into a three-point play to ignite the decisive run. Edwards also buried a pair of 3-pointers and a short jumper among his 11 points, while Mike Conley and Donte DiVincenzo drilled shots from deep as part of a burst that lasted more than four minutes. Edwards finished 6-for-11 on 3-point attempts and Randle 4-for-8, helping the Timberwolves outscore the Warriors 48-24 from beyond the arc. Minnesota shot 16-for-34 (47.1 percent) from beyond the arc, while the Warriors were 8-for-27 (29.6 percent). “The big third quarter was huge,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “I thought we came out at halftime with the type of focus and intensity and purpose on offence and attention to detail on defence is what we needed from the start. But for the most part, I thought we were lucky to be just down a bucket at halftime. “[Edwards] was one of the guys that was most vocal at half time and realised what was going on out there and we needed to be better. It started with him, really, and setting the tone.” Jimmy Butler III took just nine shots and totalled 14 points with a team-high-tying three assists for the Warriors. Draymond Green also had 14 points to go with seven rebounds, while Buddy Hield scored 13 and Brandin Podziemski had 11 to complement four steals. “[The Timberwolves] played a great game and obviously took it to us, and we’ve got to bounce back,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “We’ve got a flight to Minneapolis tomorrow and a chance to extend the series, and that’s the plan.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/13/knicks-vs-celtics-tatum-injured-in-bostons-game-4-loss-in-nba-playoffs"

Former Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso is set to become the club’s next manager on a three-year deal when he leaves Bayer Leverkusen after this season, Spanish media report. Alonso, 43, is expected to replace Real boss Carlo Ancelotti, who – despite having a year remaining on his Madrid contract – has just been confirmed as the new manager of Brazil in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup, the Brazilian FA (CBF) said on Monday. Alonso, who said earlier this month that he was leaving Leverkusen after guiding them to the double last term, will join Real before the inaugural Club World Cup in the United States from June 15 to July 13, multiple media reports said. Alonso, who also played for Liverpool and Bayern Munich, last season steered Leverkusen to their first Bundesliga title, ending the Bavarians’ 11-year domination, and they also won the German Cup and German Super Cup. Ancelotti’s departure from the club come as no surprise after Real’s 4-3 defeat at Barcelona in a thrilling El Clasico on Sunday left his side on the brink of a trophy-less season. The 65-year-old Italian, who returned for a second stint at Real in June 2021, led the Spanish giants to two Champions League and La Liga doubles, the latest of which came last season. He exits Real Madrid as the most successful manager in the club’s history with a total of 15 trophies and the first coach to claim titles in Europe’s top five leagues. However, this season Real were knocked out of the Champions League in the quarterfinals by Arsenal, and allowed Barca to fight back and win 3-2 in the Copa del Rey final. Second-placed Real are seven points adrift of Barcelona, who could secure the league title on Wednesday without kicking a ball if Real fail to win at home to Mallorca. Regardless of Real’s result, a Barca victory in the city derby away to Espanyol on Thursday would clinch the title. An official announcement regarding a managerial change is expected before Real’s last game of the season at home to Real Sociedad on May 25. Ancelotti is expected to receive a fitting farewell, recognising his four highly successful years with the club.

"sports","Why did Virat Kohli retire from Tests and what does 269 mean?","12 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","Batting star Virat Kohli announced his retirement from Tests, ending the career of the most important Indian player of his generation. After 14 years playing Test matches, Virat Kohli is retiring from the national team as one of the immortals of Indian cricket. “Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It’s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I’ll carry for life,” Kohli wrote on Monday in his Test retirement social media post. “There’s something deeply personal about playing in whites. The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no-one sees but that stay with you forever,” he added. Here is all to know about the retirement of India’s hugely impactful batter and captain: Kohli’s declining form in the five-day format of cricket may have prompted his decision to call it a day. After averaging close to 55 at his peak between 2011 and 2019, he could muster a batting average of just 32.56 over the past 24 months. Kohli’s last Test was in Sydney in January when India lost the match, and with it the series 3-1, to Australia. Apart from an unbeaten century in the second innings of the first Test in Perth, Kohli managed just 90 runs from eight innings in the five-Test series. Kohli has previously cited mental fatigue and injuries as other reasons to consider retirement. “As I step away from this format, it’s not easy – but it feels right. I’ve given it everything I had, and it’s given me back so much more than I could’ve hoped for,” Kohli said. Kohli used #269 in his Instagram post while announcing his retirement on Monday. The number denotes Kohli as the 269th player who represented India in Test cricket. Kohli will continue to play for the Indian cricket team in One-Day International (ODI) matches, but with Test match commitments removed from his schedule, he will now have more time to pursue other interests outside of the game. The 36-year-old has an expanding business empire in India. He is an active investor in large-scale fitness, hospitality and clothing companies such as Chisel fitness centre, Rage Coffee, sportswear brand One8, WROGN menswear brand and Blue Tribe, to name just a few. He is also a global brand ambassador for multiple international companies, including Puma, Audi and Vivo. Unlike many top cricketers, Kohli has not indicated that he will pursue a cricket commentary career, but he has repeatedly talked about giving back to the game in some form, with coaching a possible option in the future. In December 2024, it was widely reported that Kohli was planning to leave India and settle in London with his wife, actor Anushka Sharma, and their two children, daughter Vamika and son Akaay, according to his childhood cricket coach Rajkumar Yadav, who hinted at the impending move in an interview with Hindi newspaper Dainik Jagran. It has been reported that Kohli’s net worth is about 96 million pounds ($126m) from salaries, businesses and endorsement deals. Married to a Bollywood star, Kohli has 272 million followers on Instagram and 67.8 million on X – making him one of the most followed sports stars on the planet. His popularity has been a key factor behind cricket’s return to the Olympics at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, the organisers acknowledged last year. Greg Chappell, former Australia captain: “Kohli redefined expectations, challenged conventions, and symbolised the self-assured, unapologetic India of the 21st century,” Chappell said in a piece on ESPN CricInfo. “His departure leaves not only a statistical void but a seismic shift in energy – for there has never been another quite like him. “No Indian captain had ever marshalled a team to such commanding overseas dominance. And no batter since Tendulkar had so unequivocally ruled in every continent.” Jasprit Bumrah, India bowler: “From making my Test debut under your captaincy to reaching new heights together for our country, your passion and energy will be missed but the legacy you leave behind remains unmatched.” Sanath Jayasuriya, former Sri Lanka captain: “While the world celebrates your cricketing brilliance and records, what I admire most is your unwavering commitment to fitness and the sacrifices you’ve made behind the scenes.” Yashasvi Jaiswal, India’s opening batsman: “The impact you’ve had on test cricket, and on cricket in India as a whole, is immeasurable. To have had the chance to share the pitch with you – someone I looked up to for so many years – was more than just a privilege; it was a moment I’ll carry with me forever.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/5/12/why-did-virat-kohli-retire-from-tests-and-what-does-269-mean"
"science_tech","Pope Leo identifies AI as main challenge in first meeting with cardinals","10 May 2025",NA,"New pontiff sets out vision, pledging to continue ‘precious legacy’ of predecessor Pope Francis. Pope Leo XIV has held his first meeting with the world’s cardinals since his election as the head of the Catholic Church, identifying artificial intelligence (AI) as one of the most crucial issues facing humanity. Leo, the first American pope, laid out a vision of his papacy at the Vatican on Saturday, telling the cardinals who elected him that AI poses challenges to defending “human dignity, justice and labour” – a view shared with his predecessor, the late Pope Francis. Explaining his choice of name, the pontiff said he identified with the late Leo XIII, who had defended workers’ rights during his 1878-1903 papacy at the dawn of the industrial age, adding that “social teaching” was now needed in response to the modern-day revolution brought by AI. The late Pope Francis, who died last month, warned that AI risked turning human relations into mere algorithms and called for an international treaty to regulate it. Francis warned the Group of Seven industrialised nations last year that AI must remain human-centric, so that decisions about when to use weapons or even less-lethal tools would not fall to machines. In his speech, delivered in Italian, Pope Leo made repeated references to Francis and the mourning over his death, saying the late pontiff left a “precious legacy” and signalling that he would continue with his vision. Later on Saturday, Pope Leo made a surprise visit to a sanctuary south of Rome that is dedicated to the Madonna and of significance to his Augustinian order. People gathered in the town of Genazzano, in the square outside the main church housing the Madre del Buon Consiglio sanctuary, waiting for Leo to emerge. The pontiff shook hands and offered blessings to a few people in the crowd before entering the shrine. Leo previously visited the sanctuary, which is managed by Augustinian friars, last year, when he was a cardinal. It has been a place of pilgrimage since the 15th century.    Francis was pope for 12 years and often garnered criticism from conservative cardinals, who said he was watering down the Church’s doctrine on issues such as the inclusion of LGBTQ Catholics and women’s leadership. Leo, the former US Cardinal Robert Prevost, was a relative unknown on the global stage, before he was elected pontiff, who spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru before serving as a senior Vatican official. Saturday’s meeting took place in the same small Vatican auditorium where the cardinals had been gathering in the days before the conclave to discuss who should be the next pope. Czech Cardinal Dominik Duka was cited by the Reuters news agency as saying the situation of Catholics in communist China had been raised as an issue. The Vatican and China in 2018 signed a controversial deal on the appointment of bishops in the country, which gives Beijing some input into their selection. Conservatives have attacked the still-secret deal as a sellout, but Duka told Reuters it was necessary to keep dialogue open in places where the Church is oppressed.

"science_tech","‘Scientific asylum’: How Europe is luring US researchers amid Trump fears","5 May 2025",NA,"The EU is expected to lure US researchers looking to relocate in the wake of Trump’s attacks on universities. French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are hosting a conference in Paris to attract United States-based academics and researchers in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s targeting of universities. European Union commissioners on Monday announced half a billion euros ($568m) in incentives to lure international academics to the continent at the Choose Europe for Science conference. The meeting at Paris’s Sorbonne University is targeted at academics and researchers who fear their work will be threatened by billions of dollars of US government spending cuts for universities and research bodies as well as attacks on higher education institutions over diversity policies and pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Pro-Palestinian foreign students in the US have been arrested and sent to detention centres, often without following due process, while universities have been pressured to punish professors speaking out against the Gaza war. Campaigners said the Trump administration’s actions, including revocations of permanent resident status of students, have a chilling effect on academic freedom – a cornerstone of the American education system. Trump’s campaign against universities has given Europe’s political leaders hope they could reap an intellectual windfall. Macron’s office said the EU is targeting researchers working in the fields of health, climate, biodiversity, artificial intelligence and space. For her part, von der Leyen said she wanted EU member states to invest 3 percent of their gross domestic products in research and development by 2030. US universities and research facilities have come under increasing political pressure under Trump, including threats of federal funding cuts. Trump has pushed universities to punish pro-Palestine protesters and ordered them to drop diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) measures aimed at providing better representation for minority and poorly served communities. Trump and his voter base have accused US universities of promoting progressive ideology over conservative values. They say the universities have failed to protect the civil rights of conservative and Jewish students. On April 14, Harvard University rejected a series of demands from the Trump administration. Within hours, the US Department of Education froze nearly $2.3bn in federal funding for the Ivy League institution. Last week, Trump renewed his threat to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status, a move that could cost the university billions of dollars if implemented. Harvard has described the president’s move as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making”. The university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has sued the administration. On March 10, the Department of Education announced it had sent letters to 60 higher education institutions, warning them of “enforcement actions” if they did not protect Jewish students on campus as stipulated in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. In February, the Trump administration froze $400m in funds for Columbia University in New York City, which emerged as the epicentre of last year’s protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. Some universities have also received “stop work” orders – calls to suspend research projects funded by the government. Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, said it had received more than 75 “stop work” orders from the US Department of Defense, according to a statement released by Cornell President Michael I Kotlikoff on April 8. Elsewhere, hundreds of international students and recent graduates have had their US visas revoked – some have even been arrested – for participating in pro-Palestine demonstrations. The Trump administration is also sharpening its attacks on the National Science Foundation, the government agency that funds basic science, maths and engineering research, especially at colleges and universities. On May 2, the White House made a preliminary budget request to cut $4.7bn, or more than half of the agency’s $9bn budget. It follows two previous waves of grant cancellations in April as well as funding cuts to other public bodies. In the wake of Trump’s moves, the EU is hoping to offer a political safe haven for US scientists and academics and also to “defend our [the EU’s] strategic interests and promote a universalist vision”, an official in Macron’s office told the AFP news agency. Monday’s conference in Paris is the latest push to open Europe’s doors to US-based researchers. In April, Macron appealed to US university staff to “choose France” and unveiled plans for a funding programme to cover the costs of bringing foreign scientists to the country. “We were quite indignant about what was happening, and we felt that our colleagues in the US were going through a catastrophe. … We wanted to offer some sort of scientific asylum to those whose research is being hindered,” Eric Berton, the president of France’s Aix-Marseille University, told the UK-based Guardian newspaper. The European Research Council, an EU body that finances scientific work, told the Reuters news agency that it would double its relocation budget to fund researchers moving to the EU to 2 million euros ($2.16m) per applicant. The UK government is preparing a similar initiative. Backed by about 50 million pounds ($66m) in state funding, the scheme is designed to support research grants and cover relocation expenses for select teams of scientists, mainly from the US. In Germany, as part of coalition talks for a new government, conservatives and Social Democrats have drawn up plans to lure up to 1,000 researchers, according to negotiation documents from March seen by Reuters that allude to the upheaval in US higher learning. “The American government is currently using brute force against the universities in the USA, so that researchers from America are now contacting Europe,” Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, said in April. “This is a huge opportunity for us.” For decades, Europe has lagged behind the US when it comes to investment in higher education. According to Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, total expenditures on research and development in the EU among businesses, governments and universities was 381 billion euros ($411bn) in 2023. That same year, total research and development in the US was estimated at $940bn, according to the National Centre for Science and Engineering Statistics, a federal data agency. And the wealthiest US university, Harvard, has an endowment worth $53.2bn while that of Britain’s (and Europe’s) wealthiest, the University of Oxford, is $10.74bn. “I don’t foresee a rapid build-up of additional scientific capability that could match what the US now has … for several decades,” Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University in New Jersey, recently told Reuters. Some US scientists have pointed to what they see as another drawback – European language barriers and unfamiliar laws and employment practices. In addition, research funding and researchers’ remuneration both lag far behind US levels. The Choose Europe for Science event is expected to counter those concerns by arguing that university pay gaps will seem less significant when the lower cost of education, healthcare and more generous social benefits are taken into account. Aix-Marseille University in the south of France said it has received interest from 120 researchers at institutions across the US, including NASA and Stanford University in California, in the 15-million-euro ($17m) “safe space for science” programme it launched on March 7. The initiative aims to attract US researchers from fields including health, medicine, epidemiology and climate change. In a letter to French universities in March, Philippe Baptiste, France’s minister for higher education and research, wrote: “Many well-known researchers are already questioning their future in the United States. We would naturally wish to welcome a certain number of them.” Elsewhere, the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, which specialises in climate change research, has created two fellowships for early career climate researchers from the US and has already seen an uptick in applications. An official from Macron’s office said Monday’s conference is being held “at a time when academic freedoms are retreating and under threat in a number of cases and Europe is a continent of attractiveness”. Still, Europe is not immune from controversy. Germany has been accused of silencing pro-Palestinian voices, having recently ordered the deportations of three European nationals and a US citizen over “anti-Semitic” actions.

"science_tech","Have scientists solved the mystery of gold’s origin in the universe?","5 May 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","A study gives clues to cosmic origin of gold and heavy elements, and they were created earlier than we thought. The origins of heavy elements such as gold have been one of the biggest mysteries of astrophysics. A study has now provided a clue about the precious metal’s cosmic origins. Scientists have found that explosions in highly magnetised neutron stars, called magnetars, could have created gold in the universe. Here is more about the study: Analysis of archival data from space missions shows that a large amount of heavy metals, including gold, come from giant flares from magnetars, according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on April 29. Anirudh Patel, a doctoral student at the Department of Physics at Columbia University in New York, led the study, which used 20-year-old archival telescope data from NASA and European Space Agency telescopes to investigate how heavy elements such as iron and gold were created and distributed throughout the universe. “It’s a pretty fundamental question in terms of the origin of complex matter in the universe,” Patel was quoted as saying in an article on the NASA website. “It’s a fun puzzle that hasn’t actually been solved.” The authors estimated that magnetar giant flares could contribute up to 10 percent of the overall abundance of elements in the galaxy that are heavier than iron. Co-authors of the study are affiliated with Columbia University, Charles University in the Czech Republic, Louisiana State University, the Flatiron Institute in New York and Ohio State University. A magnetar is a type of neutron star that is highly magnetised, which means its magnetic field is extremely powerful. When a massive star explodes, it leaves a very dense, collapsed core behind, which is called a neutron star. Astronomers theorise that the first magnetars were formed after the first stars about 13.6 billion years ago, according to study coauthor Eric Burns, assistant professor and astrophysicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The Big Bang created the universe 13.8 billion years ago. On rare occasions, magnetars can release high-energy radiation by undergoing a “starquake”. Like an earthquake, a starquake can fracture the magnetar’s crust. Sometimes, magnetar starquakes bring with them a magnetar giant flare, a rare explosive event that releases gamma rays. The researchers found that magnetars release material during giant flares. However, they do not yet have a physical explanation for this. The researchers speculated about whether magnetar giant flares formed gold through the rapid process of neutrons forging lighter atomic nuclei into heavier ones. An element’s identity is defined by the number of protons it has. However, if an atom acquires an extra neutron, it can undergo nuclear decay, which can turn a neutron into a proton. A changed number of protons can change the element’s identity. Neutron stars have an extremely high density of neutrons. If a neutron star is disrupted, singular atoms can quickly capture a number of neutrons and undergo multiple decays. This leads to the formation of much heavier elements like uranium. Before this study, the creation of gold was attributed only to neutron star collisions, or kilonovas. When astronomers observed a neutron star collision in 2017 through telescopes, they found the collision could create heavy elements such as gold, platinum and lead. However, these collisions are believed to have happened relatively later in the history of the universe, in the past several billion years. However, the archival telescopic data, which was previously indecipherable, showed that magnetar giant flares formed much earlier. Hence, the study indicates that the first gold could have been made from magnetar giant flares. NASA has an upcoming mission that can follow up on these results. The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a gamma-ray telescope that is expected to launch in 2027. COSI will study energetic phenomena in the Milky Way and beyond, such as magnetar giant flares. According to the NASA website, COSI could identify individual elements created in the giant flares, helping to form a better understanding of the origin of the elements.

How well do you know its history? Take our quiz. After nearly 22 years of connecting people across the globe, Skype is shutting down on May 5, marking the end of an era for one of the pioneers of internet communication. Launched in 2003, Skype quickly became a revolutionary tool for free voice and video calls over the internet, amassing more than 300 million monthly users at its peak in the mid-2010s. The free platform changed how people communicated across borders, long before Zoom or FaceTime. In 2011, Microsoft acquired Skype for $8.5bn, aiming to make it a central part of its communications strategy. But as competitors like WhatsApp, Zoom, and eventually Microsoft’s own Teams gained traction, Skype’s popularity faded. On February 28, Microsoft said it would retire Skype on May 5 to streamline its services and prioritise Teams for communication and collaboration. The shutdown will impact both free and paid Skype users, but Skype for Business will continue temporarily.

One of the world’s most endangered amphibians – the primordial and fish-like axolotl – has successfully adapted to a new environment after being released into artificial wetlands in Mexico, scientists say. In a study that provides hope for the survival of the Ambystoma mexicanuma, a creature that has been pushed to the brink of extinction by pollution and human activity, scientists recently released 18 captive-bred axolotls into two artificial wetlands close to Mexico City. Researchers fitted the smiley-face amphibians with trackers and found they were feeding at both sites. Lead researcher Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California told the BBC it was an “amazing result”. The findings were published in the journal PLoS One and suggest the axolotl can be successfully restored to its native habitat.    Legend has it that the axolotl was not always an amphibian. Long before it became Mexico’s most beloved salamander, it was believed to be the embodiment of the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl. While there are no official estimates on its current population, the species – which is endemic to central Mexico – was classed as “critically endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species in 2019. They breathe through their gills and skin, which allows them to adapt to their aquatic environment. They can also regenerate parts of their heart, spinal cord and brain. The salamander’s skin is typically dark although an albino variety can be bred. They can stay stock still for hours in their natural habitat, buried in mud to conserve energy and wait for prey. In their main stronghold, Lake Xochimilco, located in the southern part of Mexico City, axolotl numbers have plummeted by 99.5 percent in less than two decades. In 1998, researchers estimated there were 6,000 axolotls per square kilometre in Lake Xochimilco. By 2014, this number had dropped to just 36. Mexico is a biodiversity hotspot for amphibians and reptiles owing to its unique and varied habitats from tropical rainforests and deserts to cloud forests and temperate woodlands. The waters of Xochimilco, once used for traditional farming and flushed with spring water from the mountains, used to teem with large, smiley-faced axolotls. But pollution from Mexico City’s expanding urban sprawl has damaged the water quality of the city’s canals, which flow into the lakes. Furthermore, rainbow trout, which have escaped from nearby farms, have displaced axolotls in lakes around the capital and eaten their food. Researchers have also found that increasing numbers of axolotls have died from chytrid fungus, a skin-eating disease causing a catastrophic reduction in amphibian numbers in other parts of the world from Europe to Australia. The fungus has also been found in Mexico although it is not yet a major problem. Climate change is another factor threatening the axolotl as even small shifts in temperature and rainfall can disrupt ecosystems and erode biodiversity. In 2013, scientists voiced fears that they might disappear altogether by 2025. The axolotl isn’t the only species in Mexico facing an uncertain future. The pine forest stream frog, the clarion night snake and the Mexican alligator lizard are some of the other species that are also critically endangered.    To lay the foundations for the rewilding project, researchers meticulously monitored the ecology of the axolotls to establish their ideal living conditions. Then they worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland “refuges”, or artificial wetlands, near Xochimilco by installing natural filtering systems to clean the water. The scientists then released the amphibians into two types of wetland environments: restored natural wetlands and the artificial wetlands designed specifically for conservation purposes. These environments differ in their ecological structure, water chemistry and temperatures, variables that are critical determinants of amphibian physiology and behaviour. The axolotls were tagged with radio tracking devices to keep tabs on the amphibians. One of the key findings from the study was the axolotls’ ability to navigate and inhabit both artificial and restored wetland ecosystems effectively. While biologists and officials have led efforts to save the species and its habitat from extinction, a parallel, unexpected preservation phenomenon has emerged in recent years as the creature has benefitted from an unexpected resurgence of interest. The axolotl attracted international attention after the Minecraft computer game added the creature in 2021. That same year, the Bank of Mexico also decided to print an image of the animal on the 50-peso bill. Axolotls can now be spotted all over Mexico on murals, clothing and as children’s toys. Some bakeries have caused a sensation with their axolotl-shaped cakes and biscuits. “If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,” co-lead researcher Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico told the BBC. Climate change, habitat loss and outbreaks of disease have taken their toll on amphibians around the world. Half of all amphibian species are in decline while a third are threatened with extinction. The team overseeing the axolotl study said public funding is key to preventing the loss of other species as well. Over his six-year term, however, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was in office from 2018 to 2024, reduced funding to the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources by 35 percent. While scientists involved in the project hope to restore the axolotl’s population, they also highlighted the need for government, business and individual engagement. “Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,” Ramos said. “And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done. They just need a lot of people.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/1/can-mexico-bring-back-the-endangered-axolotl"
"science_tech","Have scientists discovered a new colour called ‘olo’?","26 Apr 2025","Sarah Shamim","Described as a ‘deeply saturated teal’ colour, humans can only see it with the help of laser technology. A team of scientists claims to have discovered a new colour that humans cannot see without the help of technology. The researchers based in the United States said they were able to “experience” the colour, which they named “olo”, by firing laser pulses into their eyes using a device named after the Wizard of Oz.     Olo cannot be seen with the naked eye, but the five people who have seen it describe it as being similar to teal. Professors from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Washington School of Medicine published an article in the journal, Science Advances, on April 18 in which they put forth their discovery of a hue beyond the gamut of human vision. They explained that they had devised a technique called Oz, which can “trick” the human eye into seeing olo. The technique is named after the Wizard of Oz. In the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900, Frank Baum wrote about a man who uses tricks to fool the residents of the fictional land of Oz into thinking he’s a wizard. For instance, it is believed that the Emerald City, the capital of Oz, is so bright and vibrant that visitors have to wear special glasses to protect their eyes. The glasses are one of the wizard’s tricks, since they make the city appear greener and grander. The human eye perceives colour via three types of photoreceptor or “cone cells” in the retina. S cones pick up shorter, blue wavelengths of light; M cones detect medium, green wavelengths; and L cones detect longer, red wavelengths. “The signals from these cones are then sent through a complex series of cells in the retina that act to clean up and integrate the signal before passing it down the optic nerve through parts of the brain,” Francis Windram, a research associate at the department of life sciences at Imperial College London, told Al Jazeera. The part of the brain that the visual information is passed to is the visual cortex. In normal vision, the function of M cones overlaps with the neighbouring S and L cones, so any light that stimulates M cones also activates the other two cones. The M cones don’t function alone. “There’s no wavelength in the world that can stimulate only the M cone,” Ren Ng, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley, explained in an article published on its website. “I began wondering what it would look like if you could just stimulate all the M cone cells. Would it be like the greenest green you’ve ever seen?” So Ng teamed up with Austin Roorda, one of the creators of the Oz technology and a professor of optometry and vision science at UC Berkeley. Oz, which Roorda described as “a microscope for looking at the retina”, uses tiny microdoses of laser light to target individual photoreceptors in the eye. The equipment, which must be highly stabilised during use, is already being used to study eye disease. The work using Oz began in 2018 by James Carl Fong, a doctoral student in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. Hannah Doyle, another doctoral student at Berkeley, ran the experiments through which human subjects were able to see the new colour, olo. The shade of olo has always existed, it just falls beyond the spectrum of shades visible to the human eye. There are other such shades that we cannot see. Hence, olo is not a new colour that has come into existence, from a physical or scientific perspective. However, “from a sociolinguistic perspective, if people give new names to colours which previously were indistinguishable thanks to this technology, then maybe! It all depends on how you say it,” Windram said. Five people have seen the “new” colour – four men and one woman. All had normal colour vision. Three of the subjects, including Roorda and Ng, are the co-authors of the research paper while the other two are members of the participating lab at the University of Washington and were unaware of the purpose of the study before they took part. Those who have seen olo describe it as a teal or green-blue colour – but one they had never seen before. In the article by UC Berkeley, it is described as a “blue-green colour of unparalleled saturation”. “It was like a profoundly saturated teal … the most saturated natural colour was just pale by comparison,” Roorda said. “I wasn’t a subject for this paper, but I’ve seen olo since, and it’s very striking. You know you’re looking at something very blue-green,” Doyle said. The researchers said an image of a teal square is the closest colour match to olo. However, this square is not an olo-coloured square. The naked human eye simply cannot see the shade. “If you start with the colour in that picture, and imagine dialling up the saturation further you would get to the teal of real peacock feathers, further still would be a laser in the teal wavelength, and far beyond that is olo, outside the natural space of human colors,” Ng told Al Jazeera. “We’re not going to see olo on any smartphone displays or any TVs any time soon. And this is very, very far beyond VR headset technology,” Ng said, according to a report in the UK’s Guardian newspaper. Berkeley researchers are exploring whether the Oz technology could help people with colour blindness. “We are now studying the science of boosting the colour dimensionality of signals going from the eye to the brain,” Ng said. “If it proves possible for a colour blind person to see full colour, the next question is whether a person with full colour could be boosted to yet a higher dimension of colour called tetrachromacy.” This could contain colours beyond the rainbow that would need new names. Ng said that this is part of an ongoing scientific inquiry. Windram said success would depend on the cause of colourblindness in individuals. Deuteranomaly, which causes decreased sensitivity to green light, is the most common form of colour blindness. “In this case, a miniaturised version of this technology could theoretically be used to correct this by directly stimulating the cones when the correct colour of light hits them,” Windram said. Windram pointed out that publicity materials for the research show images of the Oz experiment on a highly stabilised table. “This would require a lot of work to miniaturise the technology, and is likely a long way off. Given that the laser must stably hit the correct cones in order to stimulate them, this may not really be feasible as a form of vision correction technologically,” he said. The concept of a colour has three main components, Windram explained: The physical, which has to do with the wavelengths of light that meet the eye; the neurological, which refers to how humans biologically process these light signals; and the societal or linguistic component, which pertains to how colours are named. “In the end I may see a colour and call it ‘red’, someone else may call it ‘rot’ or ‘rouge’ … but also another may look at it a bit more closely and say ‘well it’s claret’ or ‘crimson’.” To test this, neuroscience and AI researcher Patrick Mineault developed a website for entertainment purposes in September 2024, on which users can take a test to see how their colour perception compares to others. Humans can also perceive colour differently due to differences in factors such as “temperature” of light. This was demonstrated when a photo of a dress went viral in 2015, dividing social media users over whether the dress was white and gold, or blue and black. Windram explained that people who were deciding what colours the dress was were drawing on preconceived notions of whether the photograph of the dress was taken in warm lighting or cool lighting. Yes, different species can experience colours differently. For example, humans process three wavelengths corresponding to red, blue and green light, while the mantis shrimp, a tiny crustacean, can visually perceive 12 channels of colour instead of three. An article by the Australian Academy of Science explains that the mantis shrimp can also detect ultraviolet and polarised light, which humans cannot see. However, while the human eye can mix two colours and perceive an in-between shade – such as purple as a mix of red and blue – the mantis shrimp’s eyes cannot mix colour receptors. Meanwhile, dogs only have two types of cones and can mostly only see shades of yellow and blue.

Humans took the lead over robots and kept it easily as they raced to victory at Beijing’s Yizhuang half-marathon. Thousands of runners joined 21 humanoid robot rivals in a world-first 21km (13 miles, 352 yards) challenge in the Chinese capital on Saturday.     But not every bot was up to the task. One collapsed moments after the starting gun and lay motionless for minutes before regaining its feet. Another slammed into a barrier after only a few strides, taking its handler down with it. Some machines made it to the finish line but still trailed the humans badly. Tiangong Ultra, developed by the Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, clocked a time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The men’s winner finished more than an hour earlier. “Generally, these are interesting demonstrations,” said Alan Fern, a robotics professor at Oregon State University, “but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence.” “The robots are running very well, very stable… I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said He Sishu, a local AI engineer watching from the sidelines. Though technically in the race, the robots weren’t exactly autonomous athletes. Each one came with a team of engineers, and some needed physical support to stay upright. Chinese firms like DroidVP and Noetix Robotics fielded bots of all shapes and sizes, with a few even donning boxing gloves and headbands. Officials likened the event more to motorsport than a traditional race. Tang Jian, CTO at Tiangong’s lab, said they plan to shift focus to real-world tasks: “A focus going forward will be industrial applications … so they can truly enter factories, business scenarios, and finally households.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/4/19/humans-outrun-robots-at-beijing-half-marathon"

Scientists find the strongest evidence yet","17 Apr 2025","Al Jazeera Staff","Near a planet far, far away, astronomers have found traces of chemicals that on Earth are only produced by living beings. Astronomers have found the clearest evidence yet that life might exist beyond the solar system, from the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years away from Earth, setting off rare excitement – tinged with caution – in the global scientific community. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers led by astronomers at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom have found chemical signatures of two compounds that on Earth are only produced by living creatures.     “These are the first hints we are seeing of an alien world that is possibly inhabited,” Nikku Madhusudhan, an astronomy professor at Cambridge and the lead researcher behind the discovery, told reporters at a media briefing on April 15. “This is a revolutionary moment.” So where is the planet that might possibly host life, what evidence have scientists found, and is there reason for scepticism? The researchers relied on data captured by NASA’s James Webb telescope, which was carried into outer space in 2022, and sits about 1.5 million kilometres (930,000 miles) away from Earth, as humanity’s watchtower peering into the universe. They focused on one particular planet, K2-18b, because it had already shown promising signs as a candidate extraterrestrial body with conditions similar to those on Earth. K2-18b lies in a constellation called Leo, and is so far away from Earth that a spaceship would need to travel for 124 years at the speed of light to get there. In reality, it would take much, much longer since the laws of physics don’t allow anything other than light to travel that fast. The planet is 8.6 times heavier than Earth, and 2.6 times as large. Critically, it sits in what is known as the “Goldilocks Zone” of its sun: that’s the region around a star where a planet’s temperature could, in theory, support water in its liquid form on the surface. In 2023, Cambridge astronomers found methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the planet. That was the first time that carbon-based molecules had been discovered in the atmosphere of any planet in the habitable zone of its sun – the distance from a sun where it’s neither too hot, nor too cold, and so possible for life to survive. The scientists said that a surface covered first by an ocean, and then a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, would explain the presence of carbon-based molecules. Simply put, it was possible that the planet could have water. Researchers have now found much harder evidence suggesting that the planet might not only have the conditions to host life – but could, at least in theory, be hosting life itself. To explore planets light years away from Earth, scientists wait for them to pass in front of their suns. They study the light from the suns as it streams through the atmospheres of these planets, searching for clues. That’s how the team found traces of either dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) – or both – in the atmosphere of K2-18b. On Earth, these compounds are only produced by living beings, particularly microbes such as marine phytoplankton. What’s more, what the scientists found suggests that the concentration of these chemicals in the K2-18b atmosphere was thousands of times higher than on Earth. “It was an incredible realisation seeing the results emerge and remain consistent throughout the extensive independent analyses and robustness tests,” said co-author Mans Holmberg, a researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, United States, in a media statement on the Cambridge University website. The scientists published their findings in the peer-reviewed Astrophysical Journal Letters publication, which means that other experts in the field who studied their paper found it convincing. But that does not mean that the scientists have found irrefutable evidence of life. Far from it. Madhusudhan acknowledged that it is possible that the traces of DMS and DMDS found in the atmosphere of K2-18b are the outcome of chemical phenomena that are as of now, unknown to humanity. “It’s important that we’re deeply sceptical of our own results, because it’s only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we’re confident in them,” Madhusudhan said. “That’s how science has to work.” His colleagues in the research team agreed. “Our work is the starting point for all the investigations that are now needed to confirm and understand the implications of these exciting findings,” said co-author Savvas Constantinou, also from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy. The findings of the Cambridge-led team follow a series of breakthroughs in recent years that have excited scientists about the possibilities of finding life beyond Earth. In 2011, NASA scientists announced that they had found chemicals that are components of DNA on meteorites that had landed in Antarctica. The chemical traces they had discovered couldn’t have been the result of contamination after the meteorites landed on Earth. The only explanation – that asteroids and comets could contain the building blocks of life. A year later, astronomers at Copenhagen University tracked down a sugar molecule in a distant star system. That molecule is an essential component of ribonucleic acid or RNA, a molecule that is critical for most biological functions. In 2023, astronomers found traces of organic molecules in the gases around one of Saturn’s moons, Enceladus. And in mid-2024, scientists identified five greenhouse gases that they said would be telltale signs of life on any other planet. But the journey of science is also about setbacks. In 2005, two NASA scientists claimed they had found potential traces of extraterrestrial life on Mars after they discovered signs of methane there. Yet those findings eventually did not hold up to scientific scrutiny and NASA distanced itself from their conclusions. The Cambridge-led team has found DMS and DMDS with 99.7 percent certainty. But while that might sound like a near-perfect score, it is far from what is accepted as the benchmark for a new discovery by the exacting standards of science. For their conclusions to be considered bulletproof, they need to get to what is known as the five-sigma threshold – 99.99994 percent certainty. The astronomers believe that more hours on the James Webb telescope could help them reach that level of confirmation. “Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,” said Madhusudhan. “This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we’re alone in the universe is one we’re capable of answering.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/17/is-there-life-on-another-planet-scientists-find-the-strongest-evidence-yet"

Here is all we know about Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi, the dire wolf pups. The dire wolf, a species that went extinct some 12,500 years ago but was made famous by the Game of Thrones series, has been brought back to life, according to Texas-based biotech firm Colossal Biosciences. The company has described the dire wolf as the “world’s first successfully de-extinct animal”.     On Monday, the company announced that its research had led to the birth of three pups — Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi. But the recently born wolves have DNA which is very close to that of the grey wolf, leading to criticism of the company’s claims. So are Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi truly dire wolves? Here is what we know about them: The dire wolf, the real-life inspiration behind the wolves in HBO’s Game of Thrones, was once a dominant predator across North America. Fossils suggest that dire wolves were built for strength, not speed. They had more muscle and a heavier build than other ancient or modern wolves. But despite their size, fossils show that the dire wolf could still move well through different environments, Colossal Biosciences said. It could hunt big animals and live alongside other species. Their powerful bodies made dire wolves strong predators. These carnivores hunted large Ice Age animals like bison, horses and possibly mammoths. As many of their prey species disappeared, likely in part due to human hunting, dire wolves may have been driven to extinction, paving the way for the grey wolf to move down from northern Canada and Alaska to take over its ecological role. SOUND ON. You’re hearing the first howl of a dire wolf in over 10,000 years. Meet Romulus and Remus—the world’s first de-extinct animals, born on October 1, 2024. The dire wolf has been extinct for over 10,000 years. These two wolves were brought back from extinction using… pic.twitter.com/wY4rdOVFRH — Colossal Biosciences® (@colossal) April 7, 2025  “Many people view dire wolves as mythical creatures that only exist in a fantasy world, but in reality, they have a rich history of contributing to the American ecosystem,” said Game of Thrones author George RR Martin, who is also an investor and cultural adviser to Colossal. “I get the luxury to write about magic, but [they] have created magic by bringing these majestic beasts back to our world.”    According to Colossal, at first glance, dire wolves — their formal, scientific name is Aenocyon dirus — appeared more heavily built, with thicker legs, broader heads and shoulders, a stockier frame, and a more pronounced snout. Although they look alike, dire wolves are not closely related to grey wolves and are not their ancestors. Genetic studies reveal that the two species diverged millions of years ago and evolved separately in the Americas.  Scientists extracted and sequenced DNA from two ancient dire wolf specimens — a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old ear bone. This analysis identified 20 key genetic differences between dire wolves and their closest living species, grey wolves. Using CRISPR technology, a kind of molecular scissors to cut DNA at a specific spot, researchers edited the genomes of grey wolf cells to incorporate these 20 specific genetic variants associated with dire wolf traits, such as larger size, broader heads and thicker fur. ​ The genetic material was inserted into an egg cell from a domestic dog. Once the embryos were developed, they were implanted into surrogate dogs. Sixty-two days later, the genetically engineered pups were born. Romulus and Remus, both males, were born on October 1, 2024, while Khaleesi, a female, was born on January 30, 2025. Romulus and Remus, at six months old, each measure nearly 4 feet (122cm) in length and weigh approximately 80 pounds (36kg), with projections to reach 6 feet (183cm) and 150 pounds (68kg) at full maturity. Khaleesi, at three months, is developing similarly. The wolves exhibit physical characteristics such as white coats, larger body sizes, and broader heads. When the first dire wolf pup was delivered by Caesarean section, Colossal’s chief animal officer, Matt James, recalled gently rubbing the newborn between two towels to stimulate its first breath. “Good lord, this thing is huge,” he remembered thinking. While Colossal Biosciences referred to these animals as “de-extincted” dire wolves on Monday, some experts argue that they are genetically modified grey wolves rather than true representations of the extinct species. “We call them dire wolves,” Ben Lamm, founder and CEO of the Dallas-based startup, said. Love Dalen, a professor in evolutionary genomics based at the Centre for Palaeogenetics at Stockholm University and adviser to Colossal, also argued this is more of a philosophical question. “There’s no secret that across the genome, this is 99.9 percent grey wolf. There is going to be an argument in the scientific community regarding how many genes need to be changed to make a dire wolf, but this is really a philosophical question,” Dalen said. “It carries dire wolf genes, and these genes make it look more like a dire wolf than anything we’ve seen in the last 13,000 years. And that is very cool,” he added. The two newly born baby Dire Wolves, brought back from extinction by genetic engineering, seated on the Iron Throne. 🐺 George R.R.

The dire wolf also served as a high-profile case to demonstrate these capabilities. “This project demonstrates the awesome potential for advances in genetic engineering and reproductive technologies to recreate lost diversity,” Andrew Pask, Colossal advisory board member, said. “This work underpins pioneering research that seeks to stabilise ecosystems to prevent further biodiversity losses and to create new methods to actually restore lost biodiversity,” he added.

Still, other experts argue that we may not yet understand the full implications of these changes. “We can’t protect what we already have,” said Dan Ashe, president and CEO of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in Canada, in an interview with the Toronto Star. So far, investors have committed $435m to the company, boosting its valuation to $10.2bn. Colossal plans to monitor the pups’ growth, health, and behaviour, and may pursue further projects, including de-extinction of other species like the woolly mammoth. The broader goal is to apply the tech to real-world conservation.

United States President Donald Trump has again extended a deadline for owners of the popular video app TikTok to sell to non-Chinese buyers or be banned in the US. The executive order announced on Friday would extend the deadline by 75 days. Trump had previously extended a January deadline set out in the law passed by the US Congress last year. “My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress,” Trump posted on the Truth Social network, which he owns. He added “the deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed.” “We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal,” Trump said. The 2024 law, passed with bipartisan support, had mandated that the platform be divested from Chinese technology company ByteDance or barred in the US, citing data harvesting and national security concerns.    Earlier this year, the US Supreme Court ruled that the national security concerns outweighed freedom of speech concerns and allowed the law to stand. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order pausing the ban. The order said the delay would allow the Trump administration “the opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans”. The Trump administration has since received an array of offers from US businesses seeking to buy the platform, but ByteDance has so far publicly insisted it has no plans to sell the app. The Reuters news agency has reported the administration is coalescing around a plan for the largest non-Chinese investors in ByteDance to increase their stakes and acquire the app’s US operations. That would entail creating a new US entity for TikTok and diluting Chinese ownership to below the 20 percent threshold required by US law, according to the report.    For its part, TikTok, which has headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles, has said it prioritises user safety, and China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said China’s government has never and will not ask companies to “collect or provide data, information or intelligence” held in foreign countries. In response to Trump’s announcement, ByteDance confirmed it was in talks with the US government, but warned that there remained “key matters” to solve. “An agreement has not been executed,” the company said. Meanwhile, several news agencies reported the Beijing had frozen negotiations after Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday. Trump has also floated reducing tariffs on China, which will reach 54 percent on April 10, to push through a deal with ByteDance. TikTok is not owned by China’s government and its leaders have denied influence, although critics have pointed to Beijing’s increased controls on the country’s tech industry. About half of the US population uses TikTok, making it one of the most popular social media platforms in the country.

"science_tech","Space cowboys: The maverick pioneers of galactic travel","30 Mar 2025","George Charles Darley","Elon Musk’s SpaceX dominates the news these days, but a host of oddballs involved in space exploration came before him. The 1987 order from the German government was clear: Shut down your operations in Libya. For Lutz Kayser, this marked the heartbreaking finale to his private rocketry enterprise, OTRAG, and to his dream of “making access to space affordable for everyone”. Founded in Germany and based, in a series of bizarre turns, first in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and then deep in the Libyan desert, OTRAG had developed an IKEA-like concept for rocket design, using mass-produced modular components that could be assembled into spacecraft of various shapes and sizes.     The two African countries both offered potentially ideal conditions for rocket launching: vast, unregulated spaces far from prying eyes. But when United States and Israeli intelligence came to suspect that Libya was coopting the programme for its own military ends, it meant the end of the line for OTRAG, given that Kayser and his colleagues could face criminal charges in their home country had they persisted. In a final, devastating twist, all of OTRAG’s equipment was seized by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, but its modular approach to rocketry would go on to influence later generations of aerospace players. While government agencies sent Sputnik into orbit and put men on the moon, Kayser represented one of a succession of individual pioneers – incidentally all white and all male – who have endeavoured to conquer the skies despite being regularly dismissed by their contemporaries as absurd or deluded. And although the second explosion this year of a SpaceX rocket presents another setback for CEO Elon Musk in his ultimate mission to colonise Mars, it is likely only a hiccup in the ongoing privatisation of aerospace, the roots of which go right back to the late 19th century. Born in 1857, the Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky is credited for laying the mathematical and theoretical foundations for rocketry. As the reclusive home-schooled child of a minor government official living in a log cabin about 200km (125 miles) southeast of Moscow, Tsiolkovsky developed an interest in mathematics and physics and then, reading the science fiction of Jules Verne, became enthralled by the possibility of space travel. Although never formally educated, Tsiolkovsky went to Moscow and carried out his own research there under the influence of Nikolai Fyodorov, a proponent of “cosmism”, a philosophical movement at the time that integrated science, religion and metaphysics with a belief in the potential immortality of mankind and the harnessing of science for space exploration. In contrast to the present archetype of “capitalist turned space crusader”, Tsiolkovsky went on to earn his living as a teacher in another remote part of southwest Russia. Beset by personal tragedies – including the suicide of his son, the loss of many of his research notes and manuscripts in a flood and the arrest of his daughter for revolutionary activities – Tsiolkovsky defied misfortune to publish almost 100 works on space travel and related subjects, including designs for rockets with steering thrusters, multistage boosters, space stations, airlocks for exiting a spaceship and closed-cycle biological systems to provide food and oxygen for space colonies. And in 1895, inspired by the newly constructed Eiffel Tower, Tsiolkovsky conceived the “space elevator”, a cable theoretically attached to the Earth somewhere along the equator and reaching well beyond the atmosphere, using centrifugal power from Earth’s rotation to counter downward gravity, keeping the cable upright and taut. The immensely long cable, according to Tsiolkovsky, would enable vehicles attached to the cable to carry people and cargo all the way up to a stationary space station and back again. While that and many of his other ideas might seem far fetched even today, Tsiolkovsky is regarded as a theoretical grandfather of spaceflight. “Tsiolkovsky was the prophet of the Space Age,” Sergei Korolev, chief designer of the Sputnik-era Soviet space programme, wrote in his 1934 book Rocket Flight in the Stratosphere. “His ideas and calculations formed the foundation of modern astronautics.” Tsiolkovsky died in 1935, and although he never obtained the means to put his ideas into practice, other space pioneers of that era were developing similar theories and trying to execute them. One such figure was Robert H Goddard, the American engineer who built and launched the world’s first liquid-fuelled rocket. Goddard, born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1882, also had a deep fascination with science and mechanics from an early age. Like Tsiolkovsky, he too was galvanised by science fiction, writing in his diary as a teenager about the HG Wells novel The War of the Worlds sparking the idea of space travel in his imagination. Goddard grew up in a comfortable home as the son of a businessman and conducted experiments with kites, balloons and homemade fireworks. While climbing a cherry tree in his back yard, aged 17, he had a kind of epiphany, imagining a rocket capable of reaching Mars. This vision stayed with Goddard throughout his career and was the motivation behind his scientific curiosity and his concept of space travel. He later wrote in an unpublished autobiography, “I was a different boy when I descended the tree, for existence at last seemed very purposive.” While working on his doctorate in physics at Clark University in Massachusetts, Goddard began experimenting with solid and liquid fuel propulsion, believing that rockets could be used for high-altitude research, atmospheric studies and eventually exploration of space. He obtained patents in 1914 for a multistage rocket and a liquid-fuelled rocket engine and five years later published A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes, a groundbreaking book that outlined his theories on spaceflight, for example, that a rocket could function in the vacuum of space. Goddard faced considerable scepticism from both his peers and the media. “He does not know the relation of action to reaction,” a 1920 New York Times editorial mocked, “and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react – to say that would be absurd. Of course, he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools.” Unfazed by the criticism, Goddard countered to a reporter: “Every vision is a joke until the first man accomplishes it. Once realised, it becomes commonplace.” On March 16, 1926, Goddard succeeded in launching the world’s first liquid-fuelled rocket in Auburn, Massachusetts. Nicknamed “Nell”, the rocket flew for about 2.5 seconds, reaching a height of 12.5 metres (41ft) – seemingly unremarkable now but identified as a seminal moment in the evolution of rocketry. Goddard went on to work with the US military on rocket-assisted takeoff systems for aircraft. He died in 1945, not living long enough to learn that German scientists captured during World War II had revealed that the Nazi V-2 rocket programme was heavily influenced by Goddard’s work. Upon their release, a number of those scientists were invited to join NASA, meaning that Goddard’s theories were ultimately applied in the US mission to put a man on the moon. And Goddard would no doubt have been amused to read the retraction by The New York Times of its derisory 1920 editorial, published just prior to the Apollo 11 moon landing of 1969. “It is now definitely established,” the Times editors wrote, “that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere.” “The Times regrets the error.” One of Goddard’s students of rocketry had been a man by the name of Edwin Aldrin, whose son Buzz Aldrin was an astronaut and the second person to walk on the moon after Neil Armstrong. Today, Goddard is recognised as a visionary of the space age, and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is named in his honour. As Goddard’s life was drawing to a close, another seminal character in private space exploration was still in his infancy. Born in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1939, Lutz Theodor Kayser was spellbound by rocketry from his early childhood. He idolised Wernher von Braun, leader of Germany’s V-2 guided missile programme during World War II, who later became famous for his role in NASA. Witnessing Russia’s 1957 launch of Sputnik I, the world’s first artificial satellite, Kayser became captivated by the emerging Cold War space race between the US and the USSR. At the University of Stuttgart studying rocket propulsion, Kayser came to the conclusion that existing space programmes were overreliant on highly complex and expensive systems and that there existed a possibility of far simpler, cost-efficient modular rocket design – a flat-pack-like approach to rocketry that could potentially democratise space travel and bring it within the grasp of people around the world. Kayser joined the Working Group for Rocket Technology and Spaceflight, a student-led organisation that designed small-scale rockets and conducted test launches. He also connected with leading German aerospace figures such as Kurt Debus, a former Nazi scientist who later became an important figure in NASA. Kayser’s vision was to develop a low-cost space transportation system independent of government control, challenging the assumption that space exploration could only be managed by state-run agencies, such as NASA and the Soviet space programme. In 1975, backed by private investors, Kayser founded OTRAG (Orbital Transport und Raketen AG – Orbital Transport and Rocketry Ltd) with a unique concept: Instead of building a single large, expensive spacecraft, the idea was to manufacture modular rocket segments that could be mass-assembled in different configurations, enabling space expeditions to be cheaper and more frequent. However, OTRAG faced a challenge in that launching rockets required access to vast and unrestricted land tracts – not readily available in Germany or indeed anywhere in Western Europe – leading Kayser to embark upon a rather outlandish and controversial strategy. Introduced to President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire by a fellow German businessman, Kayser negotiated the leasing of a 100,000sq-km (38,600sq-mile) launch site in a remote and underpopulated region of that country, enabling OTRAG to conduct its tests free from any regulations and far from any unwanted scrutiny. That apparent solution turned out to be its downfall. Initial OTRAG test launches were apparently successful, but both Western and Soviet intelligence agencies began to speculate that the operation was secretly developing military missiles – German arms development being an especially sensitive issue after World War II. Mobutu was pressured by both NATO and the Eastern Bloc to shut down the entire programme, and in 1979, OTRAG had no option but to leave Zaire. Undeterred, Kayser searched for an alternative location and found a warm welcome in Libya, whose fiercely independent President Gaddafi was only too willing to defy Western powers and host such a grandiose aerospace project. The Libyan desert provided another optimal test site, again without much regulatory control. OTRAG conducted several test launches from the Sebha region of the Sahara, using multiple small engines, potentially enabling a “scalable” rocket system for various commercial or military applications. But geopolitics interfered once again. The US and its NATO allies soon concluded that OTRAG’s technology could be applied to long-range ballistic missiles, and the CIA and Israel’s Mossad spy agencies both accused Libya of co-opting OTRAG for its own missile capabilities, potentially in league with North Korea and Pakistan. By the mid-1980s, the resulting diplomatic and military pressure made it impossible for OTRAG to continue operating in Libya – hence the 1987 German government directive to cease all operations. The company shut down its base there in 1987, only for its assets to be seized by the Gaddafi regime, apparently, as suspected, to further its own missile development – an unsuccessful bid in the absence of Kayser’s blueprints and personal expertise. This ended Kayser’s vision of accessible space travel, but surprisingly, he remained in Libya for another decade, teaching rocket science at a university in Tripoli. It is unclear why he chose to stay, but given the financial clout of Libya at that time, it could have simply been the temptation of a large, tax-free salary after his business losses. Kayser withdrew from the public spotlight and died in 2017, aged 78, on a trip to India, but his work remains a notable chapter in the history of private rocketry. OTRAG is now recognised as a foundation stone of contemporary space travel, its impact seen for example in the “modularity” of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, which uses nine identical engines in its first stage, and in the now common aerospace strategy of using relatively cheap, over-the-counter equipment instead of more expensive proprietary components. Commercialisation of the aerospace industry was kick-started in earnest by an American man called Elbert Leander “Burt” Rutan. Born in 1943 in Estacada, Oregon, the young Rutan inherited his dentist father’s passion for aviation, sketching futuristic aircraft designs, testing model gliders and experimenting with wind tunnels. With a degree in aerospace engineering from California Polytechnic State University, Rutan went on to work as a flight test engineer at Edwards Air Force Base in California, where he gained experience with experimental aircraft and aerodynamics. He left the US air force in 1972 to found the Rutan Aircraft Factory in Mojave, California, aiming to produce easy-to-build, high-performance aircraft. Having succeeded with two planes – the light and fuel-efficient VariEze, and the ultra-lightweight Voyager – Rutan set his sights on space travel. With funding from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen – this connection between tech money and space travel being the shape of things to come – Rutan embarked upon Space Ship One, a “suborbital” spacecraft designed to go beyond the atmosphere but not make a full orbit of the Earth. On June 21, 2004, SpaceShipOne became the first private spacecraft to reach outer space – that is, to get beyond Earth’s atmosphere – returning safely with a “feathering” re-entry system, allowing it to descend safely without complex heat shields. This achievement, followed by the equally successful Space Ship Two – which was subsequently used and developed by the British entrepreneur Richard Branson in his Virgin Galactic space tourism enterprise – heralded the present “corporatisation” of space travel, underwritten by the financial masters of the universe. “Welcome to the dawn of a new space age,” declared Branson upon the successful touchdown of his touristic spacecraft Galactic 01 on June 29, 2023 – provided, of course, that you have $600,000 for the suborbital ride. The 72-minute voyage takes passengers about 85km (53 miles) high, where they can experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth. The corporate space race is now in full thrust, and it is perhaps only a matter of time before Musk and his archrival, Jeff Bezos, fulfil their respective ambitions to dispatch millions of human workers to the moon and onwards, begging the question: Is an interplanetary commute any more desirable than the kind we put up with here on Earth? And just as modern aviation owes a debt to the dashing innovators who risked life and limb in the earliest attempts to fly, so too are today’s aerospace corporations beholden to the cosmic pioneers who showed that science fiction can become reality, that boyhood dreams can lead to breakthrough innovations and that the ideas of eccentric outliers can one day be universally accepted as genuine scientific advances.

"opinions","‘Adolescence’ is right: We’re failing both young men and women","15 May 2025",NA,"Teaching boys how to deal with anger is critical to stopping the spiral that ends up in violence. In 2014, I was teaching English to undergraduate freshers at a university in Massachusetts. A student in class, behind on his work, grew angry with a new assignment we were working on. He picked up a chair and threw it past an aisle of students and across the room. He then sat down as if nothing had happened. The chair did not strike anyone, but several students had to duck their heads. As someone who struggles with (post-traumatic stress disorder) PTSD and dissociation as a result of childhood abuse and domestic violence, I found myself frozen in front of my classroom, momentarily flashing back to previous violent incidents with a former partner.     I recalled this scene with my former student when I recently rewatched the four-part series Adolescence on Netflix. The series explores the consequences that befall a 13-year-old boy, his family, and community after he kills a female student who has bullied him online. As the police question Jamie, the main character, he continually denies his involvement. Eventually, a video of the murder is shown with Jamie stabbing the teenage girl. To me, the fact that a boy could kill a girl and convince himself that he had done nothing wrong points to a major societal failure. Boys are taught that acting on anger is acceptable. We have normalised it. When I was 25, I had been dating a man for several months. A friend of his was visiting and asked me if I was ready to go on an outdoor adventure with the two of them. In the spirit of the day, I said, “I was born ready.” My boyfriend misinterpreted this as a sexual innuendo and immediately slapped me hard across the face. No one said a word, and the day proceeded as if nothing had happened. My boyfriend’s friend never reached out to me after the incident. He never did or said anything that suggested that he thought the violence was unwarranted. That taught me that the violence was normal, acceptable behaviour. My student’s behaviour frightened me to the point that afterwards, I did not feel confident that I could keep the other 20 class students safe in his presence. I approached my supervisors, who suggested I contact both campus security and our on-campus learning disabilities centre, which offered services for students with physical or cognitive issues. I had expected campus security to have a conversation with the student and to document the chair event, so a paper trail could exist should further acts or threats of violence continue. Instead, campus police said no one had been hurt, so there was no incident to report. The learning disabilities centre could tell me that the student was in their programme, but that they could not share any information with me about the student or how best to handle him. Addressing these issues in young boys is critical to preventing serious violence in their behaviour when they grow older. We are failing our children and stand at a crossroads with increased violence in boys and young men that will only escalate if viable solutions are not found. My abusive former partner did not have a healthy male role model as he grew up. According to my abuser and his mother, he was not taught to curb his temper or monitor his anger. I believe that awareness must begin with parents and at an early age. Frustration and anger must be recognised, named and confronted. If young people can be taught to identify the actions that trigger their defensive or even uncontrollable responses, escalation can be prevented. When parents can acknowledge the child’s behaviour and point it out, solutions and alternatives to acting out can be offered. “Time out” at home and school should not be used as a punishment but as an opportunity to step back, take a breath, and re-evaluate the situation. The process must be repeated and reinforced to become a new pattern of response. Encouraging boys to identify and express their feelings, whether they be anger, sadness, or frustration, can be a huge step forward in teaching them to become aware of those feelings, rather than just acting on them. Once children enter school, discussions regarding feelings and appropriate actions must become a regular part of class instruction. A new definition of “time out” can offer students a practice in self-care, a healthy alternative to acting out anger. A time out in a school therapist’s office or with a guidance counsellor, or other trained staff, can become a safe place to calm down and discuss alternative responses to acting on anger. In classroom instruction, role-play situations can help students learn and practise alternative responses to anger and aggression when they are confronted with upsetting stimuli. This type of practice and reinforcement can become a new automatic response if children are given sufficient feedback and opportunity in both home and school situations. Teaching issues of mental health in classrooms beginning at an early age can help destigmatise emotions of shame, isolation and powerlessness. Embarrassment and shame can be significant triggers for both boys and girls, and in Adolescence, did in fact lead Jamie to fatally stab the girl who bullied him online. Shame and anger are normal human responses to certain situations, but addressing these feelings from a very young age can assist children in learning healthy and safe ways of coping rather than lashing out against others. My abuser was also experiencing shame when he assumed my response to his friend was sexual. As a society, we teach boys and men that anger is acceptable. TV commercials and movies portray men as both physically and mentally strong to the point where any expression of vulnerability makes them weak and inferior. It is time we teach boys and men that they are stronger, not weaker, when they are aware of and comfortable with their emotions. Until men and boys can identify and switch emotional gears instead of acting on anger, we will never be able to create a society where all human beings — boys and men, girls and women — are able to interact with mutual respect and safety.

"opinions","This is Trump’s moment to deliver peace to the Middle East","14 May 2025","Jeffrey Sachs","By supporting Palestine’s UN admission, he can unlock regional stability, economic growth – and a lasting legacy. The Arab world stands at a crossroad – a moment of truth that hinges on the region’s unified leadership and moral clarity. As President Trump arrives in the Gulf this week, seeking investments and strategic partnerships, the opportunity for regional peace and security is overwhelmingly clear. The Arab leaders should explain clearly to President Trump that peace and economic development in the Middle East are within reach and depend on one critical condition: The admission of Palestine to the United Nations as its 194th member state. For this to become a reality, the United States must lift its veto on Palestine’s entry to the UN. As the President meets with regional partners, he should hear an unambiguous message from his counterparts: All Arab partnerships with the US and of course with Israel are contingent upon a lasting peace through the two-state solution, which the US can bring about.     What is at stake is not simply a diplomatic negotiation. The two-state solution is a practical imperative and a test of international resolve. There can be no peace in the region, and no long-term development, if Israel continues to maraud its way through Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and others. Israel must be compelled – through diplomacy – to live within its own borders, and to allow Palestine to live within its legal borders, those of June 4, 1967. If the US backs the admission of Palestine to the UN, this will happen. The stakes could not be higher. The US would receive a windfall of investments. The Middle East would achieve normalcy and the basis for a surge of economic development, and both Israel and Palestine would live in peace. The Trump administration, in a significant departure from previous administrations, is moving towards a foreign policy centred on pragmatic deal-making diplomacy. Under his guidance, diplomatic negotiation channels were opened with Iran – as both countries enter their fourth round of negotiations in Oman regarding nuclear talks. President Trump has repeatedly stated his willingness to reach consensus: “I think we’re going to make a deal with Iran”, and is even willing to meet Iran’s president. Similarly, the US reached a ceasefire agreement with the Houthis in Yemen last week, an encouraging step for both global trade and stability. Another bold diplomatic manoeuvre is the US direct negotiations with Hamas, which resulted in the release of hostage Edan Alexander. It has become increasingly clear that President Trump holds US strategic interests above all else, and that he correctly views peace as his country’s overarching strategic interest. This translates into true potential for peace in the Middle East. The foes of peace in Israel’s extremist government want us to believe that there is an intrinsic, almost innate reason for the war on Palestine to continue. In essentially racist terms, Netanyahu and his ilk are arguing that peace with Palestinians, based on Palestinian political self-determination and self-rule, is impossible. The result is Israel’s brutal destruction and de facto annexation of Gaza and Israel’s ongoing war on Palestinians in the West Bank. Netanyahu’s government has two main interests: Continuing the war in Gaza and the West Bank to block a Palestinian state, and drawing the United States into direct confrontation with Iran. Both are contrary to US interests. This Israeli government is now completely isolated in the international community. Even the United Kingdom, previously a staunch supporter of Netanyahu’s war, has shifted its position. Minister for the Middle East Hamish Falconer stated that the government’s position is “crystal clear”: “We strongly oppose the expansion of Israel’s operations. Any attempt to annex land in Gaza would be unacceptable.” The vast majority of UN member states have already demonstrated their support for the two-state solution, most recently by adopting the UN General Assembly resolution. The will of the global community is clear: Israel’s illegal occupation must end, and a Palestinian State must be established in accordance with international law. This is possible under the mantle of the United Nations, this upcoming June, during the High-level International Conference on Palestine. Peace has been the generational clear-cut position of the League of Arab States, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and all regional partners. The Arab Peace Initiative (API), adopted at the Beirut Summit in 2002 and reiterated consistently over the years, demands Israel’s withdrawal from the occupied territory and the establishment of a Palestinian state as the basis for peace and diplomatic normalisation with Israel. President Trump and the Arab leaders have a historic opportunity this week to end a conflict that has raged for one century. By adopting the two-state solution, Trump would not only bring peace to Israel and Palestine, but also to Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. An agreement between the US and Iran regarding nuclear non-proliferation and an end to US sanctions on Iran would immediately come within reach. Belligerents could lay down their arms, and rebuilding and economic development could come to the forefront. In short, this week offers the extraordinary opportunity for the US and the Arab world to make history, for the benefit of the entire Middle East, including Israel and Palestine, and indeed for the benefit of the entire world.

"opinions","Medical professionals must speak out and act on Gaza now","13 May 2025",NA,"I spent 22 days in Gaza. I saw so much death and destruction but also unbelievable courage, compassion and dedication. We must not abandon our colleagues there. I had closely followed the genocidal war in Gaza for nine months when an opportunity came around to volunteer as part of a medical mission organised by the United Nations, World Health Organization and the Palestinian American Medical Association. As a trained nephrologist, a doctor who treats patients with kidney disease, I felt there was a critical need for specialised medical care amid the collapse of the healthcare system in Gaza and the high number of medical specialists who had been killed.     I also felt it was my duty as a Muslim to help the people of Gaza. Islam teaches us that whoever saves one life, it is as if he had saved all of humanity; taking care of others is an act of worship, and standing up against injustice is a moral obligation. I believe my degrees are not meant to simply hang on the walls of an air-conditioned office or help me drive the nicest car or live in an expensive neighbourhood. They are a testament to the fact that I have taken an oath to dedicate my expertise to the service of humanity, to maintain the utmost respect for human life and to offer my medical knowledge and compassion to those in need. So on July 16, I departed for Gaza with a few other medics. We entered the strip through the Karem Abu Salem crossing. We went from observing the prosperity, comfort and wealth of the Israeli side to recoiling at the destruction, devastation and misery of the Palestinian side. We basically saw what apartheid looks like. On our short trip through southern Gaza to reach our destination in Khan Younis, we saw many buildings bombed, damaged or destroyed. Homes, schools, shops, hospitals, mosques – you name it. The amount of rubble was sickening. To this day, I can’t unsee the landscapes of destruction I witnessed in Gaza. We were accommodated in Al-Nasser Hospital because it was too dangerous to stay at any other place. We were welcomed and cared for so much that I felt embarrassed. We were seen as saviours. I treated patients with kidney problems, worked as a primary care physician and sometimes helped during mass casualty events in the emergency room. Dialysis requires clean water, sterile supplies, reliable electricity, medications and equipment that must be maintained and replaced – none of which was guaranteed under the Israeli blockade. Each dialysis session was a challenge. Every delay increased the risk of my patients dying. Many of them did die – a fact I struggled to accept, knowing that under normal circumstances, many of them could have been saved and lived normal lives. I remember the smiling face of one of my patients, Waleed, a young man who suffered from kidney failure caused by early-onset high blood pressure, a condition that, with access to proper treatment, could have been managed appropriately. Dialysis was Waleed’s lifeline, but he couldn’t get an adequate number of sessions due to the Israeli blockade causing severe shortages of medical supplies. Malnutrition and worsening living conditions only accelerated his decline. I remember how short of breath he was, his body overloaded with fluid and his blood pressure dangerously high. And yet, every time I saw him, Waleed greeted me with a warm smile, his spirit somehow intact, his mother always by his side. A few months after I left Gaza, Waleed passed away. Another patient of mine was Hussein, a gentle, kind-hearted, deeply respected man. His children cared for him with love and dignity. He suffered from severe hypokalaemia and acidosis: His body’s potassium levels were dangerously low, and acid built up to toxic levels. To address his condition, he needed basic medications: potassium supplements and sodium bicarbonate pills. These were simple, inexpensive, life-saving medicines, and yet, the Israeli blockade did not allow them in. Because he could not find these pills, Hussein was hospitalised multiple times for intravenous potassium supplementation. Despite his immense suffering, Hussein remained gracious, brave and full of faith. When speaking, he always repeated the phrase Alhamdulillah (praise be to God). He passed away a few weeks ago, I was told. Waleed and Hussein should be here – smiling, laughing, living happily with their families. Instead, they became casualties of siege and silence. These are two of so many tragic stories I know of and I witnessed. So many beautiful lives that could have been saved were lost. Despite this grim reality, my colleagues in Gaza continue to do their utmost for their patients. These are medics who are bruised in every way. They are not only battling the daily struggles of life like all other Palestinians in Gaza but also witnessing daily horrors of headless babies, amputated limbs, fully burned human beings and sometimes the lifeless remains of their own loved ones. Imagine working with no anaesthesia, limited pain medications, very few antibiotics. Imagine surgeons scrubbing with plain water, children undergoing amputations with no sedation, full-body burns patients’ dressings being changed with no pain relief. Still these healthcare heroes just keep going. One of the nurses I worked with, Arafat, made a deep impression on me. He was living in a makeshift shelter with multiple family members. It offered no protection against the elements – the cold winter, the scorching heat or the drenching rain. He starved – like all other Palestinians in Gaza – losing 15kg (33lb) in nine months. He walked 2km to 3km (1 to 2 miles) every day to work with worn-out sandals, facing the danger of Israeli drones bombing or shooting him in the street. And yet, the smile never left his face. He took care of more than 280 dialysis patients, treating them with care, attentively listening to their anxious families and uplifting his colleagues with light humour. I felt so small next to heroes like Arafat. His and his colleagues’ resilience and persistence were unbelievable. While in Gaza, I had the opportunity to visit Al-Shifa Hospital with a UN delegation. What once was Gaza’s largest and most vital medical centre was reduced to ruins. The hospital that was once a symbol of hope and healing had become a symbol of death and destruction, of the deliberate dismantling of healthcare. It was beyond heartbreaking to see its charred, bombed-out remains. I stayed in Gaza for 22 days. It was an absolute honour to visit, serve and learn life from the resilient people of Gaza. Their relentless courage and determination will stay with me until I die. Despite witnessing what I could have never imagined, I did not have the urge to leave. I wanted to stay. Back in the United States, I felt profound guilt that I left behind my colleagues and my patients, that I did not stay, that I did not do enough. Feeling this constant heartache, I cannot understand the growing number of people who are accustomed to the daily reports of Palestinian deaths and images of torn bodies and starving children. As human beings and as health workers, we cannot quit on Gaza. We cannot stay silent and passive. We must speak out and act on the devastation of healthcare and attacks on our colleagues in the Gaza Strip. Already fewer and fewer healthcare workers are being allowed to enter Gaza on medical missions. The current blockade has prevented all medical supplies from going in. We, as healthcare professionals, must mobilise to demand an immediate lifting of the siege and free access to medical missions. We must not stop volunteering to help the struggling medical teams in Gaza. Such acts of speaking out and volunteering give our colleagues in Gaza the hope and comfort that they have not been abandoned. Let us not allow Gaza to be just a symbol of destruction. Instead, let it be the example of unbreakable spirit. Stand, speak and act – so history remembers not just the tragedy but also the triumph of human compassion. Let us uphold human dignity. Let us tell Gaza, you are not alone! Humanity is on your side! The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.

"opinions","India’s ‘new normal’ of perpetual war will damage its democracy","13 May 2025",NA,"The BJP whipped up war fervour in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack. Now it cannot ‘disappoint’ with peace. On May 12, two days after the announcement of a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally addressed the nation. He stated that the Indian army had only “paused” military action and Operation Sindoor, launched in the aftermath of the April 22 massacre in Pahalgam to target “terrorist hideouts”, had not ended. “Now, Operation Sindoor is India’s policy against terrorism. Operation Sindoor has carved out a new benchmark in our fight against terrorism and has set up a new parameter and new normal,” he said.     Modi’s speech was clearly not meant to reassure the Indian people that the government can guarantee their safety or security and is seeking peace and stability. Instead, it was meant to warn that the country is now in a permanent warlike situation. This new state of affairs has been called not to secure the national interest but to satisfy Modi’s nationalist support base, which was bewildered and disappointed with the announcement of the ceasefire by United States President Donald Trump. The detrimental impact that this new militarised normal will have on Indian democracy is clearly a price worth paying, according to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The truth is, the political establishment unwittingly put itself in a difficult position when it decided to capitalise politically on the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack in India-administered Kashmir and whip up war fervour. While victims of the attack like Himanshi Narwal, who survived but lost her husband, navy officer Vinay Narwal, called for peace and warned against the targeting of Muslims and Kashmiris, the BJP called for revenge and embraced anti-Muslim rhetoric. As a ruling party, it did not feel the need to take responsibility for failing to prevent the attack or explain the carelessness in securing tourist destinations. It immediately converted this act of killing into an act of war against India. Actions followed the hate rhetoric swiftly. Muslims and Kashmiris were attacked in several parts of India, and arrests were made of those criticising the Indian government. In Kashmir, nine houses were blasted immediately as punishment of those who had any link with “terrorists”, and thousands were detained or arrested. People with Pakistani passports were deported, and families were broken. Then, Operation Sindoor was announced. The Indian army’s targeting of Pakistani sites was accompanied by frenzied calls from the mainstream media for the complete obliteration of Pakistan. Major TV platforms – entirely falsely – declared the Karachi port had been destroyed and the Indian army had breached the border. The war cries and fake news emerging from the TV studios and the frantic messaging from the IT cells of the BJP led its supporters to believe that a decisive battle against Pakistan had been launched and its fall was imminent. In parallel, critical voices were swiftly silenced. The Indian government requested the blocking of 8,000 accounts from the social media platform X, including those of BBC Urdu, Outlook India, Maktoob Media, veteran journalist Anuradha Bhasin and political content creator Arpit Sharma. Just when war fever had gripped the BJP’s support base, the sudden announcement of a ceasefire by the US caught them by surprise. The truce was seen as a retreat and an admission of weakness. Some of the BJP’s online supporters turned on the foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, who had declared the ceasefire as the representative of the government of India. He was viciously attacked, and his timeline was flooded with abusive and violent messages, calling him a traitor and coward. His daughter also faced abuse. The trolling was so severe that Misri had to lock his social media accounts. Interestingly, but unsurprisingly, we did not hear about the blocking of any social media accounts trolling him or any action by the police against them. There was no action to protect Narwal either after she faced abuse and humiliation by the same crowd for daring to call for peace. Meanwhile, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights, which focuses on rights violations in marginalised communities, has released a report saying 184 hate crimes against Muslims – including murder, assault, vandalism, hate speech, threats, intimidation and harassment – have been reported from different parts of India since April 22. On Saturday, Misri claimed that India was a democracy that allowed criticism of the government. But the experience of critics raising questions about the objective and efficacy of Operation Sindoor has been bitter. Criticism of government requires parliamentary deliberation. But the government has been ignoring calls by opposition parties to convene the parliament, which means stalling democratic dialogue. Now that the prime minister has announced the operation has not ended, total loyalty from the Indian people will be demanded. Opposition parties would feel compelled to suspend all questions to the government. Muslims would feel a burden to prove their allegiance to the nation. The government will happily blame a dire economic situation that is of its doing on the war. There will be freedom of speech, but only for those who speak in favour of the BJP. Democracy in India thus remains in suspended animation as the country now faces a permanent enemy and a permanent war.

"opinions","Is Trump abandoning Israel? Not really","12 May 2025",NA,"The US president may have excluded Israel from his pursuit of megadeals in the Gulf, but he remains a committed supporter. United States President Donald Trump descends on Tuesday on the Middle East for a regional tour that will begin in Saudi Arabia and include stops in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. It is a business trip in every sense of the term, involving potentially trillions of dollars in investment and trade deals. The UAE, for example, has already pledged $1.4 trillion in investments to the US over 10 years in sectors ranging from artificial intelligence and energy to mining and aluminium production. Saudi Arabia, for its part, has committed to investing $600bn in the US over the next four years. According to the Reuters news agency, Trump will also be offering the kingdom an arms package to the tune of $100bn.     Meanwhile, in keeping with the president’s solid history of nepotism and self-enrichment, it just so happens that the Trump Organization is currently presiding over real estate projects and other business ventures in all three Gulf countries he is slated to visit. And yet one country is conspicuously absent from the regional itinerary despite being the US’s longstanding BFF in the Middle East: Israel, the nation that has for the past 19 months been perpetrating genocide in the Gaza Strip with the help of gobs of US money and weaponry. The official Palestinian death toll stands at nearly 53,000 and counting. Although the genocide kicked off on the watch of his predecessor President Joe Biden, Trump was quick to embrace mass slaughter as well, announcing not long after reassuming office that he was “sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job” in Gaza. It appears, however, that Israel is taking a bit too long for the US president’s liking – particularly now that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has prescribed an intensified offensive against an enclave that has already been largely reduced to rubble. The issue, of course, is not that Trump cares if Palestinian children and adults continue to be massacred and starved to death while Israel takes its sweet time “finishing the job”. Rather, the ongoing genocide is simply hampering his vision of the “Riviera of the Middle East” that will supposedly spring forth from the ruins of Gaza, the creation of which he has outlined as follows: “The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it.” So while war may be good for business – just ask the arms industry – it seems that too much war can ultimately be a counterproductive investment, at least from a Trumpian real estate perspective. In the run-up to Trump’s Middle Eastern expedition, reports increasingly circulated of tensions between the US president and the Israeli prime minister – and not just on the Gaza front. On Sunday, NBC News noted that Netanyahu had been “blindsided – and infuriated – this past week by Trump’s announcement that the US was halting its military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen”. Even more annoying to the Israeli premier, apparently, is Trump’s refusal to endorse military strikes on Iran. Plus, the US has reportedly discarded the demand that Saudi Arabia normalise relations with Israel as a condition for US support for the kingdom’s civilian nuclear programme. What, then, does the strained Trump-Netanyahu rapport mean for the ever-so-sacred “special relationship” between the US and Israel? According to an article published by the Israeli outlet Ynetnews: “Despite the tensions, Israeli officials insist behind-the-scenes coordination with the Trump administration remains close, with no real policy rift.” The dispatch goes on to assure readers that US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has “denied rumors that Trump might announce support for a Palestinian state during the visit” to the three Gulf nations. Of course, it’s not quite clear what sort of “Palestinian state” could ever be promoted by the man proposing US ownership of the Gaza Strip and expulsion of the native Palestinian population. Although Israel may be sidelined on this trip, that doesn’t mean it won’t continue to serve a key function in general US malevolence. Just last month, Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir – source of the idea that there is “no reason for a gram of food or aid to enter Gaza” – was hosted by Republican officials at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. After a dinner held in his honour, Ben-Gvir boasted that Republicans had “expressed support for my very clear position on how to act in Gaza and that the food and aid depots should be bombed”. Flashy trillion-dollar Gulf deals aside, rest assured that the Trump administration remains as committed as ever to capitalising on Israeli atrocities.

"opinions","India tried to project strength but ended up showing weakness","11 May 2025",NA,"In the aftermath of Operation Sindoor, India’s image as a regional hegemon has frayed. On May 10, United States President Donald Trump announced a “full and immediate” ceasefire between India and Pakistan brokered by his administration. US media reported that, alarmed by intelligence signalling further escalation, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles drove urgent mediation. Vance warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of catastrophic risks and encouraged direct talks between India and Pakistan. The announcement of the ceasefire was received across the world with a sigh of relief. The spectre of a nuclear exchange, which according to one 2019 study could kill up to 125 million people in less than a week, had fuelled regional anxiety and spurred the US diplomatic frenzy.     In India, however, Trump’s announcement was seen differently in some quarters. Former Indian army chief Ved Prakash Malik posted on X: “Ceasefire 10 May 25: We have left India’s future history to ask what politico-strategic advantages, if any, were gained after its kinetic and non-kinetic actions.” MP Asaduddin Owaisi wrote on the same platform: “I wish our PM @narendramodi had announced the ceasefire rather than the President of a foreign country. We have always been opposed to third party intervention since Simla (1972). Why have we now accepted it? I hope the Kashmir issue will not be internationalised, as it is our internal matter.” The latter comment likely refers to Trump’s statement that he is willing to work with India and Pakistan “to see if, after a ‘thousand years,’ a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir”. The ceasefire announcement by the US president appears to have been perceived by some in India as a sign of the Modi government’s retreat under US pressure while his offer to mediate on Kashmir is being seen as an indication that India’s longstanding rejection of third-party intervention is being undermined. In South Asian geopolitics, perception often outpaces reality – until reality bites. India has long projected regional dominance, bolstered by economic growth and nuclear might. Yet its actions in the aftermath of the April 22 massacre carried out by the Resistance Front (TRF) in Kashmir exposed its vulnerabilities. Intended to assert strength, India’s response faltered, boosting Pakistan’s regional standing and leaving Modi’s government diplomatically weakened. On May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle terrorist bases linked to groups like the TRF, which, it claims, is supported by Pakistan. Backed by French-made Rafale jets, the operation sought to project Modi’s strongman image amid domestic outrage. Yet its success was contested. Pakistan reported civilian casualties, including children, while India insisted only terrorist sites were hit. Pakistan’s air force scrambled its own jets to deflect the attack and claimed it downed five Indian jets, including three Rafales. Two US officials confirmed to the Reuters news agency that a Chinese-made J-10 jet shot down at least two Indian planes, aided by Chinese intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) support. India has not acknowledged any losses. Indian media initially claimed devastating strikes on Pakistani cities, including Karachi’s seaport, but these reports, which were clearly part of propaganda efforts, were proven false. On May 9, India launched missile attacks on Pakistani bases, including one near Islamabad, Pakistan claimed. The Pakistani army retaliated with short-range missile and drone strikes targeting Indian airbases at Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj. Indian air force officer Vyomika Singh reported Pakistani drones and munitions hit civilian and military targets. India’s image as a regional hegemon frayed. The Indian government clearly overestimated its Rafale jets and underestimated Pakistan’s Chinese-backed ISR systems, which enhanced battlefield precision. China’s military support for Pakistan has increased significantly in recent years. Since 2020, it has accounted for 81 percent of Islamabad’s military imports. For years, some Indian defence analysts warned that India’s military was unprepared for a China-supported Pakistan, given its limited US or Russian backing for its high-risk Kashmir gamble. Others criticised the government’s foreign policy for encouraging China-Pakistan rapprochement. Their warnings remained unheeded in New Delhi. The events of the past few days exposed India’s strategic limits, replacing ambiguity with global scrutiny. The kneejerk reaction in New Delhi may be to increase the defence budget and deepen even further the militarisation of Kashmir. As the Indian government plans its next steps, it should do well to consider that the status quo of shadow war and the cycle of covert aggression fuelling unrest is untenable. Both nations’ intelligence agencies have long backed proxies, driving instability from Kashmir to Afghanistan. The path forward rests on New Delhi and Islamabad making wise choices. Restraint, not rhetoric, should shape policies moving forward. Failure to do so risks geopolitical turmoil, economic stagnation and hardship for millions. Home to a quarter of the world’s poorest people and more than 350 million illiterate adults, India and Pakistan cannot afford prolonged strife. Continued tensions could derail India’s growth and cripple Pakistan’s fragile economy, dwarfing any tactical gains.

"opinions","What the Christians of the Holy Land expect from Pope Leo XIV","11 May 2025",NA,"We hope to see in the new pope a father who will stand by our side and protect us from oppression. Many Christians of the Holy Land rejoiced at the election of Pope Leo XIV as the successor to Saint Peter. Many of us hope that the new pope will follow the legacy of his predecessor, Pope Francis, particularly with regard to issues of justice and peace. The Holy See has historically played an important role in supporting the Christian presence in the Holy Land, whether through church activities, engagement with influential parties in and around the region, or through material and moral support. This has been reflected in the establishment of institutions such as the Pontifical Mission in Jerusalem, Bethlehem University, the Benedictus Center in Nazareth, and most recently, the donation by Pope Francis of the Popemobile to serve as a mobile clinic for children in Gaza.     Some of the most impactful moments in our recent history have been papal visits to our land — starting with Pope Paul VI in 1964, followed by Pope John Paul II in 2000, Pope Benedict XVI in 2009, and concluding with Pope Francis in 2014. We, Christians in the Holy Land, hope that Pope Leo XIV will not only come to visit us but also help address some of the challenges we face today in the birthplace of Christianity. As a community of 230,000 people, we are working to strengthen the Christian presence as an active component of the local society, in collaboration with its other components. However, we do need help. One of the main issues affecting Christian lives in Israel and Palestine is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is a persistent source of regional instability that fuels violence in various forms, which kills many, including Christians. Rising religious and political extremism makes many of us feel like strangers in our own homeland. Economic deterioration and the declining number of people coming for pilgrimage in the Holy Land due to the conflict are leading to a loss of livelihood and worsening socioeconomic conditions. Widespread despair is driving many to emigrate or plan to leave in the near future, dwindling the numbers of our community. Many local Christians want the Holy See to engage with key global and regional players to achieve a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In his last sermon, Pope Francis spoke about the urgent need for peace in Gaza. In his first sermon, Pope Leo XIV called for an immediate ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the Strip. We welcome these statements and hope he will continue to do his utmost to promote peace in the Holy Land. In Palestine, the situation remains unclear due to the Israeli occupation of all territories meant to form a Palestinian state, the ongoing war in Gaza, and the limited authority of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank — not to mention Israel’s full annexation of East Jerusalem. This reality calls for thoughtful action by the Church, both at the level of the Holy See and locally, to provide people with hope in these dark times. In Israel, there is a pressing need for cooperation between the Holy See and the local church — bishops, priests, and believers — to resolve many issues that affect the Christian and non-Christian communities. It is crucial to work with all segments of the local society to pressure the state to treat all its citizens equally and preserve their dignity. Christians hope that the Holy See can collaborate with us in our efforts to achieve equality. We, as a community, face Israeli laws that discriminate against us based on ethnicity and religion; we need support in our efforts to have such laws repealed. It is also essential to work towards resolving painful issues that have negatively impacted the Christian presence, such as the case of the villages of Iqrit and Biram, whose Catholic Christian residents were expelled before their homes were destroyed by the Israeli authorities in 1951. Since then, the residents and their descendants have been demanding to return to their ancestral lands, but are being denied this right. There is also a need for stronger intervention by the Holy See to support Christian institutions operating under Israeli control, which face growing challenges, such as attempts by some municipalities to impose heavy taxes in violation of past agreements, the clear discriminatory underfunding of Christian schools by Israeli authorities, and threats against church property. Many Christians of the Holy Land also hope that Pope Leo XIV will work to enhance unity among them, including efforts to reach a unified date for major religious holidays, especially Christmas and Easter. They also call for increased joint efforts among churches to organise pilgrimages to the Holy Land that include not only visits to religious sites but also interactions with the faithful who live there. This is important because it would help us raise global awareness about the challenges we face and feel an integral part of the universal Church. As a whole, Christians in the Holy Land, like their fellow Christians around the world, desire to see a father in Pope Leo XIV — a father who visits them and welcomes their visits, consults with them and listens to their concerns, protects them from harm, stands with them when they are attacked or oppressed, and follows in the footsteps of the Church’s founder, who never hesitated to defend the oppressed regardless of how powerful the oppressor might be. Pope Leo XIV should know that he has many children in the Holy Land who love him and understand how busy he and the Holy See are with so many issues around the world. In the Holy Land, Christians have prayed — and continue to pray — for his success in his mission, fully aware of how complex it is. But above all, the children need their father — and that is what they expect the most: that he will always stand by their side, despite how busy he might be.

"opinions","My nephew asks if he will eat meat only in heaven. I struggle to answer","10 May 2025",NA,"The most difficult aspect of the famine in Gaza is having to explain it to little children. When on March 2, we heard all crossings into Gaza were closed, we thought it would not last more than two weeks. We really wanted a normal Ramadan where we could invite our surviving relatives for iftar and not worry about what food we could find to break our fast. But it did not turn out this way. We spent the holy month breaking our fast with canned food.     My family, like most families in Gaza, had not stocked up on food or essentials, as no one expected the crossings to close again, or the famine – or even the war – to return. In the days after the closure, food and other basic goods disappeared from the markets, and prices skyrocketed. A kilogramme of any vegetable jumped to $8 or more, sugar $22 and baby formula $11. A sack of flour previously costing $8, went up to $50; within two months, it reached $300. Most people in Gaza could not afford these prices. As a result, families, including my own, began reducing the number of meals they eat, limiting themselves to just breakfast and dinner, and shrinking each person’s portion – half a loaf of bread for breakfast a whole one for dinner. Men, women, elderly people and children would stand in front of bakeries and charity kitchens for hours, in shame and sorrow, just to get a few loaves of bread or a small plate of food. For some families, this would be their only food for the day. All the residents of central Gaza, where I live, relied on only three bakeries: two in Nuseirat and one in Deir el-Balah. The crowds at these bakeries were overwhelming, blocking roads and halting movement in the area. Every day, there were cases of fainting and suffocation due to the pushing and shoving. In the end, only a small number of those who waited since morning would get bread. My father would go to the bakery before sunrise to line up, instead of using what’s left of our flour, because we did not know how long this situation would last. But he would find the line already long, dozens having slept outside the bakery. He would stay until noon, then send my brother to take his place in the line. In the end, they would return with nothing. On March 31, the World Food Programme announced the closure of all of its bakeries, including the three we could access, due to the depletion of flour and the lack of gas needed to run the ovens. This marked the start of true famine. Soon, charity kitchens started closing as well because they ran out of food stock. Dozens of them shuttered in the past week alone. People grew even more desperate, many taking to local groups on Facebook or Telegram to beg for anyone to sell them a bag of flour at a reasonable price. We live in a “lucky” neighbourhood where the kitchen still functions. My niece Dana, who is eight years old, lines up in front of it every day with her friends, waiting for her turn as if it were a game. If she receives a single scoop of food, she comes back running, feeling very proud of herself. And if her turn doesn’t come before the food runs out, she returns in tears, complaining about how unfair this world is. One day during Ramadan, a boy, displaced with his family to the al-Mufti School near our home, was so desperately trying to get food that he fell into the pot of hot food the charity kitchen was cooking. He suffered severe burns and later died from them. The signs of famine began becoming apparent everywhere about a month and a half after the closure of the crossings. We see them in every aspect of our lives – sleeping on an empty stomach, rapid weight loss within, pale faces, weak bodies. Climbing stairs now takes us twice the effort. It has become easier to get sick and more difficult to recover. My nephews, 18-month-old Musab and two-year-old Mohammed, developed high fever and flu-like symptoms during Ramadan. It took them a whole month to get better because of the lack of food and medicine. My mother has been suffering from severe vision loss due to complications after eye surgery she had in late February. The malnutrition and the lack of eye drops she needed to recover have made her condition much worse. I myself have been unwell. I donated blood to al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat just days before the border was closed and this seriously affected my physical health. Now, I suffer from extreme weakness in my body, weight loss and difficulty focusing. When I went to the doctor, he told me to stop eating canned food and to eat more fruit and meat. He knew that what he was saying was impossible to do, but what else could he say? Perhaps the most difficult part about this situation is having to explain famine to little children. My nieces and nephews cannot stop asking for things to eat that we simply cannot provide. We struggle to convince them that we are not punishing them by hiding food, but that we simply do not have it. Five-year-old Khaled keeps asking for meat every day while looking at food pictures on his mother’s phone. He stares at the images and asks whether his martyred father gets to eat all this in heaven. Then he asks when his own turn will come, to join his father and eat with him. We struggle to answer. We tell him to be patient and that his patience will be rewarded. I feel helpless seeing daily scenes of famine and desperation. I ask myself, how can the world stay silent while seeing children’s bodies go thin and fragile and the sick and injured die slowly? The occupation uses every method to kill us – by bombing, starvation, or disease. We have been reduced to begging for a piece of bread. The entire world watches and pretends that it cannot even give us that. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.

"opinions","As the conclave gathers, let debt justice be Pope Francis’s legacy","8 May 2025","Fletcher Harper","Honour Francis’s vision for 2025 by cancelling unjust debts and funding climate action in the Global South. Pope Francis was never drawn to pomp or grandeur. He asked to be buried in a simple casket, and his burial was held not in the ornate halls of the Vatican, but in a modest neighbourhood church, true to his lifelong humility. As a conclave gathers today to choose his successor, world leaders and faith communities are reflecting on how best to carry forward his legacy. Francis would not have wanted ornate tributes or empty gestures. He would have wanted action – especially in the form of debt cancellation for developing countries and a renewed commitment to climate justice. Francis envisioned 2025, a Jubilee year for the Catholic Church, as a time to restore justice – among people, between nations, and with the Earth itself. A time to wipe the slate clean and begin again, not in words but in deeds. That vision aligns closely with another urgent global imperative: 2025 is also the year by which scientists warn that global carbon emissions must peak and begin to decline if we are to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.     But instead of preparing for a just transition, many of the countries most affected by climate change are caught in a worsening “climate-debt doom loop.” From cyclones in Mozambique to floods in Pakistan and prolonged droughts in Malawi, climate-related disasters – caused overwhelmingly by industrialised nations – are tearing apart the infrastructure and economies of developing countries and displacing millions of people. Yet rather than receiving long-overdue funding and support, climate-vulnerable nations are being drained by record levels of debt payments – many owed to the very countries and institutions most responsible for global warming. According to calculations by 350.org, in 2023, developing nations spent roughly 40 times more on servicing foreign debt than they received in net climate assistance. This is not only unjust – it’s self-defeating. Funds that should be invested in clean energy, sustainable agriculture, reforestation, flood defences and public health are instead diverted to repay wealthy creditors. Meanwhile, the escalating impacts of climate change are driving up borrowing costs, pushing vulnerable countries even deeper into debt. For every $10 spent on debt payments, an additional dollar is effectively added as a premium for climate risk. The consequences ripple far beyond environmental damage. Debt service now consumes more government spending in many countries than healthcare and education combined. Over three billion people live in countries where more is spent on interest payments than on meeting basic human needs. This is not only economically short-sighted – it is a moral scandal. Pope Francis named this reality with unflinching clarity. In his final New Year’s message, he wrote: “Foreign debt has become a means of control whereby governments and private financial institutions of the richer countries unscrupulously and indiscriminately exploit the human and natural resources of poorer countries, simply to satisfy the demands of their own markets.” He reminded us that the financial debt of the Global South is the mirror image of the massive ecological debt the Global North owes. Research by Oxfam and others estimates that wealthy nations – responsible for more than 75 percent of historic carbon emissions – owe developing countries around $5 trillion each year in climate-related reparations. That’s a feasible figure, especially when you consider that these same wealthy governments currently spend about $7 trillion annually subsidizing fossil fuel industries. There is precedent for bold, transformative action. In the last Jubilee year – 2000 – a global movement led by civil society and faith groups secured the cancellation of over $100bn in debt for 35 heavily indebted nations. The results were remarkable: Tanzania and Uganda eliminated primary school fees, boosting enrolment. Mozambique and others expanded access to healthcare. Several countries saw improved credit ratings and increased foreign investment. That initiative was a recognition that economies must serve people, not the other way around. But it fell short of addressing the deeper structural flaws that enable recurring debt crises. In the years since, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, indebtedness has surged again. Now, the combined pressure of climate impacts, declining aid and economic instability – including trade disruptions triggered by protectionist policies – threatens to unleash a global debt tsunami. The poorest nations may be hit first and hardest, but this is not a crisis they face alone. A world shackled by unjust debt cannot act decisively to stop climate collapse. The debt crisis, if left unresolved, will sabotage efforts to protect people and the planet alike. Pope Francis reminded us that forgiveness, renewal and justice are not abstract ideals. They are moral and practical imperatives in an age of ecological breakdown. As the world prepares for the next chapter of papal leadership, we must act in his spirit: by resetting the rules of a broken financial system and building one rooted in equity, solidarity and care for our common home.

"opinions","As Ukraine looks towards peace, Bosnia offers a cautionary tale","8 May 2025",NA,"As Ukraine moves towards the eventual end of its war with Russia, it faces a pivotal question: What kind of peace is worth having? The 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the Bosnian War, offers both inspiration and a stark warning. It succeeded in halting bloodshed, but at the cost of long-term dysfunction. Bosnia and Herzegovina emerged divided, politically paralysed, and perpetually dependent on international oversight. Ukraine cannot afford to follow that path. A rushed or externally imposed settlement – especially one prioritising “balance” over functionality – risks turning Ukraine into a fractured, weakened state locked in limbo. The temptation to accept any peace to stop the war must be resisted. Not all peace is created equal.     The Dayton Agreement created two autonomous entities within Bosnia, each with its own president, parliament, and bureaucracy, and governed by a collective presidency that required consensus. The result? More than 180 ministers for a population under 3.5 million, and a state too fragmented to govern or reform. Ethnic divisions were frozen into law, and nationalist deadlock has since stymied progress, including efforts towards European Union membership. Ukraine faces a similar risk if a peace deal grants “special status” or federal autonomy to Russian-occupied territories like Donbas. Such an arrangement would embed dysfunction and division at the heart of Ukraine’s political system. Pro-Russian proxies with veto power could block defence, foreign policy, or EU and NATO integration – giving Moscow influence in Kyiv without firing another shot. Worse still, this would create an internal deadlock that hollows out Ukrainian sovereignty. Bosnia’s experience shows how political paralysis, born from structural compromise, can entrench instability rather than resolve it. For Ukraine, that would mean a future shaped not by peace, but by permanent vulnerability. This dynamic plays directly into President Vladimir Putin’s vision of a “Greater Russia”, where former Soviet states remain under Moscow’s thumb. Just as nationalist actors in the Balkans have sought to redraw Bosnia’s borders, Russia seeks to dominate Ukraine by freezing its conflict rather than resolving it. Bosnia also offers another caution: the dangers of long-term international trusteeship. The Office of the High Representative, created under Dayton, still holds sweeping powers over Bosnia’s domestic affairs. While useful in preventing renewed conflict, this arrangement has stunted institutional development and left Bosnia reliant on foreign actors. Ukraine must reject any peace that removes its agency or places it under indefinite international supervision. Temporary stabilisation may be necessary, but Kyiv must remain the final authority on its laws, governance, and future direction. A sovereign state cannot exist with foreign capitals acting as its ultimate decision-makers. That’s why Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s 2022 decree – refusing negotiations with Russia while Putin remains in power – deserves a second look. While morally justified, it may limit Ukraine’s room to manoeuvre if global power dynamics shift. Peace must be principled, but also strategically flexible. Diplomacy, like war, requires room to adapt. As Bosnia’s former Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey once said, peace negotiations are like poker. At Dayton, Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic understood the stakes better than his counterparts. Bosnia’s Alija Izetbegovic lacked a clear strategy. Croatia’s Franjo Tudjman let pride dictate terms. And Richard Holbrooke, the United States envoy, played for legacy as much as for peace. Today, new players are at the table. As US political winds shift and figures like Donald Trump re-emerge, there’s a growing risk that Ukraine could be treated as a bargaining chip in a larger geopolitical game. It must not be reduced to a pawn. Any durable peace must be rooted in sovereignty, justice, and national unity. Ukraine needs credible security guarantees— not just promises, but real deterrence against future aggression. Justice, too, must be non-negotiable. Blanket amnesties for war crimes and collaborators would not bring reconciliation, only delay it. Occupied territories must be reunified under Ukrainian law — not left in limbo as autonomous zones or proxy-administered enclaves. Doing so would institutionalise division and lay the groundwork for future conflict. Ukraine also needs a well-funded, strategic roadmap for reconstruction and European integration. Rebuilding physical infrastructure is essential, but so is embedding Ukraine within the political and economic structures of the European Union. Above all, Ukraine must retain full strategic autonomy — the right to choose its alliances, shape its institutions, and define its future without coercion from Moscow or even from well-meaning Western partners. Ukraine is not a buffer state. It is a sovereign nation whose people have paid an extraordinary price for self-determination. That must be the foundation of any peace agreement—not the ambitions of foreign powers or the expediency of a quick fix. Compromise is a part of diplomacy. But not all compromises serve peace. Bosnia teaches us that a flawed peace can entrench division, delay healing, and keep a country caught between war and true resolution. Ukraine’s mission is clear: achieve peace, but not at the cost of sovereignty, unity, or long-term viability. Ending a war is hard. Building a just and sustainable peace is harder still. Bosnia achieved the former. Ukraine must do both. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.

"opinions","Eastern Europe bets on Trump – but at what cost?","7 May 2025",NA,"Eastern Europe’s love affair with Trump runs deep – but economic fallout may soon cool the romance. Despite Donald Trump’s fraying popularity at home, there is a corner of the globe where his brand remains remarkably resilient: Eastern Europe. Last Sunday, the Trump-loving far-right populist George Simion topped the first round of Romania’s presidential elections, securing over 40 percent of the vote and a realistic path to the top office. Echoing Trump’s pledge to “Make America Great Again,” Simion promises to “give back to the Romanian people what was taken from them”. He is not an outlier. In neighbouring Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban openly embraces the mantle of Trump’s European standard-bearer. Trumpworld’s influence in the region extends beyond politics. Jared Kushner is spearheading a real estate venture in downtown Belgrade, and Donald Trump Jr has recently completed his second tour in months of Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria, rubbing shoulders with politicians, business elites and crypto entrepreneurs eager to forge ties with the Trump family.     Eastern Europe’s fascination with the “America First” president is fuelled by both ideological alignment and hard-nosed pragmatism. The MAGA message resonates widely across the post-communist landscape. A recent Gallup poll ahead of the 2024 United States election showed that 49 percent of respondents in Bulgaria and Hungary – and a staggering 59 percent in Serbia – preferred Trump over Kamala Harris. This is no coincidence. From the AfD supporters in former East Germany to the ruling Georgian Dream party in Tbilisi, illiberal actors across the region are rallying against the liberal democratic consensus. Their views on issues like LGBTQ rights, race, gender, multiculturalism, vaccines and Ukraine mirror those of Trump’s base. Trump’s friendliness towards Vladimir Putin has further enhanced his appeal in Russia-friendly nations like Serbia. There is also a transnational dimension. Eastern European diasporas in the US tend to favour Trump, drawn by social conservatism or competition with other ethnic and racial groups. Their counterparts in Western Europe are similarly inclined, even as they benefit from the very open-border policies they often deride. In Romania’s recent election, 60 percent of Romanians living in the European Union and the United Kingdom voted for Simion. Many had previously backed Calin Georgescu, a far-right figure publicly defended by US Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference. At home, elites see in Trump a potential enabler. A powerful friend in Washington who overlooks corruption and democratic backsliding could prove advantageous both domestically and internationally. The prospect of US foreign policy becoming indistinguishable from the Trump Organization’s business agenda is attractive in a region rife with opaque sectors like infrastructure, energy and mining. The recent US-Ukraine critical minerals deal is seen as a blueprint for currying favour with a transactional White House. This relationship is already yielding dividends. In April, the Trump administration reversed sanctions on Antal Rogan, a close Orban ally, originally imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act by the Biden administration. The move has raised hopes elsewhere: in Bulgaria, tycoon and political heavyweight Delyan Peevski – also sanctioned under Magnitsky – is reportedly eyeing a similar reprieve. Yet Eastern Europe’s Trump infatuation may prove fragile. Ironically, Trump’s economic nationalism threatens to undercut the very economies governed by his ideological allies. Hungary and Slovakia, both heavily reliant on automotive exports, stand to suffer under US tariffs. Slovakia’s car industry alone accounts for nearly 30 percent of national exports and employs 10 percent of the workforce. Even a modest 10 percent tariff could decimate jobs in Central Europe’s industrial belt. Such economic fallout would have political consequences. In the Czech Republic, it might boost populist Andrej Babis, a Trump-like businessman. But in Hungary, Orban already faces a serious challenge from Peter Magyar, with elections looming next year. In Slovakia, Robert Fico governs with a slim majority and increasing public dissent – his long-term survival is uncertain. Trumpism has already proven a liability for right-wing allies in Canada and Australia. While Eastern Europe remains more receptive, the region is not immune to the risks of over-identification with a movement that pits itself against the European Union, liberal values and global economic integration. The MAGA revolution may still fire up crowds in Bucharest and Belgrade – but its contradictions could just as easily burn those who embrace it.

"opinions","Harvard talks free speech but silences Palestine","7 May 2025",NA,"It stands up to the Trump administration, but bows to its own billionaire donors. At Harvard, Palestine remains unspeakable. My sister was standing with a few other students under the dim glow of Harvard Yard’s old lampposts, casually smoking and chatting. “Oh, you’re Palestinian?” one of them asked as he leaned in to light his cigarette from hers. “My cousin is in the IDF [Israeli army].” Then he placed the cigarette in his mouth backwards, the lit end burning between his teeth. “This is how my cousin smoked while shooting Palestinians at the border,” he said. “So those idiots couldn’t see the flame.”     That evening, shaken, my sister called our parents and later reported the incident to her resident tutor. She searched for a way to file a formal complaint but found none. Arabs weren’t considered a “protected class”. In the charged political climate of late 2001, hate speech like this wasn’t just tolerated – it was invisible. More than two decades later, little has changed. A report released in April 2025 by the Harvard Presidential Task Force on Combating Anti-Muslim, Anti-Arab, and Anti-Palestinian Bias described a “deep-seated sense of fear” among Muslim and Arab students, faculty and staff. The campus climate, the report noted, was marked by “uncertainty, abandonment, threat, and isolation”. Nearly half of Muslim students surveyed said they felt physically unsafe at Harvard while an overwhelming 92 percent of all Muslim students, faculty and staff revealed that they feared professional or academic consequences for expressing their personal or political views. Harvard has fashioned itself as a free-speech warrior on the national stage for refusing to negotiate with the Trump administration on its sweeping demands for the university to drop its diversity, equity and inclusion measures and punish student protesters. However, inside Harvard’s campus walls, we have seen President Alan Garber oversee a systematic erasure of teaching, research and scholarship about Palestine, at a time when more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have been forcefully displaced and are facing starvation under a relentless Israeli siege. Long before Harvard evaded a hostile takeover from our billionaire president, it capitulated to the demands of its billionaire donors in matters of student discipline, campus speech and academic freedom. To please its right-wing donors, Harvard adopted a one-sided conceptualisation of campus safety, in which speaking up against Israeli state violence towards Palestinians is considered threatening. As a result, university administrators rush to address anti-Semitism on campus, as they should, but they also censor and eliminate speech and scholarship which is critical of Israel in the name of fighting antisemitism. Meanwhile, anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab racism, and Islamophobia are less than an afterthought. University administrators remain silent as students, faculty and staff experience doxxing, harassment and death threats for speaking up about Palestinian human rights. They have shared international students’ information with the Department of Homeland Security, as students on nearby campuses have been abducted by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, detained and deported for objecting to Israel’s international law violations. Beyond turning a blind eye to intimidation and abuse, the university’s leaders also routinely take action to erase Palestinian speech, scholarship, advocacy and views. Last year, the Harvard Corporation, the university’s unelected governing body, overruled the faculty and barred 13 seniors from graduating for protesting the genocide in Gaza, breaking with decades of disciplinary precedent. The university has banned the only undergraduate Palestine advocacy group twice, through inconsistent enforcement of the university’s ambiguous and “ever-evolving” event co-sponsorship policy, which, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned, “raise[s] the specter of viewpoint discrimination”. In a little-publicised Title VI settlement from January, the US Department of Education found that Harvard failed to meaningfully investigate or sufficiently respond to 125 cases of discrimination and harassment reported through its anonymous reporting hotline, particularly those “based on Palestinian, Arab, and/or Muslim shared ancestry”. Although President Garber has said Harvard should condemn “hateful speech” under the institutional voice policy, this did not apply to the gruesome “jokes” former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett made about giving students exploding pagers for interrupting his speech at Harvard Business School in March 2025. The handful of teaching and research programs where faculty study Palestine at Harvard have been censored, eliminated, or are under threat of elimination. In a matter of months, Harvard cancelled a panel featuring Palestinian children from Gaza at Harvard Medical School, ended its only partnership with a Palestinian university, and eliminated the Religion and Public Life program at the Harvard Divinity School, which addressed Israel/Palestine as a case study. Harvard also dismissed the leadership of the Center for Middle East Studies, as an “offering of sorts to its critics”, according to The New York Times. The elimination of Harvard programmes about Palestine is especially chilling given that all of Gaza’s universities have been demolished, more than 80 percent of its schools have been destroyed or damaged, and professors, teachers and students in Gaza have been systematically attacked. The UN calls this “scholasticide” – the systemic obliteration of education through the destruction of educational infrastructure and arrest, detention, or killing of students, staff, and teachers. The erasure and elimination of knowledge production by Palestinians and about Palestine at Harvard and other universities chills speech in defence of Palestinian human rights in the US, and thus materially affects the safety of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. At this time last year, campuses across the US experienced an unprecedented mobilisation in support of Palestinian freedom, which put a spotlight on the overwhelming public opposition to Israel’s assault on Gaza. Eventually, the opposition to Israel’s conduct against Palestinians became so vocal that then-President Joe Biden – an ardent supporter of Israel – threatened an arms embargo against Israel if the humanitarian situation in Gaza did not improve. Today, after Harvard and other universities suppressed protests against Israel’s total war on Gaza, Palestinian suffering and death are met with growing silence in the US. As public and media attention drifts away from Gaza, the pressure on American leaders to intervene – or even acknowledge the scale of the crisis – has all but disappeared. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) recently declared that “the humanitarian situation in Gaza is now likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities.” Jonathan Whittall, the local head of OCHA, stressed that what’s unfolding in Gaza no longer resembles conventional warfare. “People in Gaza are telling me they feel like it’s the deliberate dismantling of Palestinian life in plain sight,” he said. Malnutrition is surging as Israel has sealed the borders to food, medicine, and all humanitarian aid for over two months. Meanwhile, scenes that should shock the world – children’s bodies thrown into the air by explosions, families burned alive – have become what Whittall called “everyday atrocities”. Both the Trump administration and Harvard’s billionaire donors clearly understand the important role universities play in shaping US society and public opinion. As Harvard leaders proclaim their commitment to “viewpoint diversity”, we can rest assured that we will hear more from speakers like Jared Kushner, who spoke at the Harvard Kennedy School last year about his plan to “finish the job” and develop Gaza’s “valuable waterfront property”, instead of Palestinian child amputees whose plight might make us feel uncomfortable or complicit. It is heartening that hundreds of university presidents signed a letter opposing President Trump’s attempted takeover of US higher education. But for decades, their institutions have eagerly bent to the will of billionaire donors. In just the past year and a half, these donors have shaped everything from campus speech to student discipline – even course syllabi. In this corrupt bargain, the concept of “campus safety” has been weaponised to suppress speech on what the UN and other human rights organisations have called genocide. The language of anti-discrimination has been twisted to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion programs – Harvard’s own DEI office now quietly renamed the “Office of Community and Campus Life”. This moment cannot be separated from a broader history. It echoes the 1971 Lewis Powell memo, which outlined how corporations could infiltrate US institutions – especially universities – to align them with corporate interests. Today, the “Palestine exception” has become a key entry point for an ideological capture of higher education, decades in the making. For Harvard and its peers to resist federal overreach while yielding to oligarchic donors is not resistance at all – it’s surrender. If we don’t fight both forces together, we may soon be unable to fight at all. If, as President Garber wrote, “the fearless and unfettered pursuit of truth liberates humanity,” then he – and all of us – must demand that liberation without exceptions, caveats, or fear. For every single one of us. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.

"opinions","Palestine and the decline of the US empire","6 May 2025",NA,"The US fears a free Palestine because it sees it as the beginning of its own end. It has been 19 months now since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza. The International Court of Justice is investigating a “plausible genocide”, while the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes. Scholars of genocide, major human rights organisations, and United Nations experts have identified what is going on in Gaza as genocide. People across the world have marched to call on their governments to act to stop it. There is a single power that stands in the way of putting an end to this genocide: the United States. One administration has handed over to another, and yet there has been no change in policy. Unconditional support for Israel seems to be a doctrine that the US political establishment is unwilling to touch.     Various analyses have suggested that at the root of this “special relationship” are Judeo-Christian values and a shared democratic path; others have argued that it has to do with the two-party system and the donor class dominating US politics. But the reality is far simpler. The US views Israel as a critical ally because it helps promote US global supremacy at a time when it is facing inevitable decline. Israel’s survival in its current settler-colonial form – the US elites believe – is closely tied to maintaining US supremacy. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the US has been leading a unipolar world as the sole superpower. As a continuation of Western imperial global dominance, the US empire holds much sway over global economic, political, and cultural matters, often with devastating consequences for the lives of millions of people around the world. Like all empires, the US solidifies and expands its position of supremacy and hegemony in the world through its overwhelming military force. Through the US infrastructure of organised imperial violence, it is able to secure access to and control of resources, trade routes, and markets. This, in turn, guarantees continuous economic growth and dominance. But in recent years, we have seen signs that US supremacy is being challenged. The momentum to do so built up in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 US financial crisis, which turned into a global one. It demonstrated the negative impact of US supremacy on the world economy and motivated powers such as China and India to take action to protect themselves from it. The BRICS coalition of economies emerged as their shared response on the economic front. In the following years, various US foreign policy mishaps, including the US failure in Afghanistan, its waning influence in Africa and its inability to prevent the Russian invasion of Ukraine, also demonstrated the limits of US global power. The rise of US President Donald Trump and far-right populism in the United States reflected the fact that cracks were appearing in the very core of the US-led so-called liberal order. No empire has ever easily accepted its decline, and neither will the US. It intends to hold onto its status as the unquestionable superpower, and for that, it needs imperial outposts to stand loyally by its side. Throughout the Cold War, Western Europe and Israel stood as the US’s junior partners in its confrontation with the Soviet Union in Europe and the Middle East. Today, while the decades-old transatlantic alliance seems to somewhat falter, the US-Israeli relationship appears as strong as ever. Israel has demonstrated loyalty as an imperial outpost. It has played a key role in supporting US imperialism in two ways. First, Israel helps the US secure its access to and control over one of the most critical markets for any empire: the energy market. The Middle East is an important force in the global energy trade, and its oil and gas policies can have a tremendous impact on the world economy. What the US fears the most is losing its dominance in the global energy markets to a competing power, which is why it wants to secure its interests by establishing a regional order in the Middle East that overwhelmingly favours its imperial power. This new order is about giving the US a major advantage over any competitor seeking to make inroads into the region, namely China. For the administration of former US President Joe Biden and its successor, the Trump administration, the Israeli genocide of Palestinians and aggression against neighbouring countries are about establishing this new security reality in the region by eliminating hostile groups and governments. That is why US support for them has not stopped. Second, Israel plays a critical role in advancing US military supremacy. The US provides Israel with billions of dollars in aid, which is in fact a form of self-investment in developing military capabilities and expanding sales. The Israeli state uses these funds to buy weapons from US arms manufacturers, which then use Israel’s deployment of that weaponry in the Middle East as testing and marketing tools. The US military-industrial complex is thus able to sell more weapons and continue to innovate and grow to ensure the US has a military edge over its rivals. In this sense, Israel is one of the most critical parts of the US imperial machinery. Without it, the US would find it challenging to maintain its imperial power in the Middle East. It is for this reason that Biden once famously proclaimed that if Israel did not exist, the US would have to invent it. Over the past year, we have witnessed an unprecedented attack on the Palestine solidarity movement in the US, which has affected all public spheres, including education and healthcare. We have also seen an intensification of US threats against states, such as South Africa, for their support for Palestine. Based on the magnitude of the resources and energy that the US empire expends on the elimination and subjugation of Palestinians, one has to wonder, what is it about a stateless people with no economic and diplomatic capital or military power that terrifies the world’s sole superpower? The answer is that the US empire views a free Palestine as the beginning of its own end. The US is actively working to prevent the world from doing the right thing and isolating the Israeli state economically and politically because it fears what may come next. Such isolation would make it difficult for Israel to continue its existence as a settler colonial project, and ultimately could lead to a decolonisation process. The end result of that would be Palestinians and Israelis living together under a new decolonial political system that would be integrated into the region and would no longer serve imperial power. A decolonised entity in Palestine/Israel would be a major step in the decolonisation of the world order itself and its liberation from US imperial power. And this is what the US dreads. In this sense, it is in the self-interest of the overwhelming majority of the world’s nations to follow this path. The future of Palestinians, who are facing the real threat of elimination and total subjugation today, depends on this. And the future of many other nations, if they wish to avoid the current unspeakable brutalities that Palestinians are facing all on their own, also depends on this. As much as the US needs a settler colonial Israel to stave off its decline, the world, particularly the Global South, needs a decolonised Palestine to hasten US decline. Palestine, not just metaphorically but literally, stands in the way of US and Western imperialism’s onward march towards continued global supremacy.

"opinions","Canada’s unity against Donald Trump is a myth","6 May 2025",NA,"Almost one in five Conservatives support Trump’s annexation bid. These numbers must be taken seriously. Canada is a haven for pleasing myths. One agreeable caricature popular these days is of a land and a people united in happy solidarity to resist an unpopular president clamouring to add Canada as the 51st star on the stars and stripes flag.     Uncomfortable truth be told, more than a few Canadians are not wishing Mark Carney all that well as Canada’s Harvard-trained technocrat-turned-prime minister meets today for the first time the domineering commander-in-chief of the United States, Donald Trump. A fair share of Canadians – still smarting from the Liberal Party’s remarkable revival on election night last week – will be rooting for the other guy who keeps talking about erasing the “artificial line” that separates the two bordering nations. While Carney insists that Canada’s sovereignty is non-negotiable, I suspect Trump will continue to bellow privately and publicly that his ungrateful northern neighbour, having mooched off the US for far too long, best join it to form one “beautiful country”. Despite broad expressions of new-found Canadian nationalism, including the boycott of US-made stuff and travel south of the 49th parallel, Trump has good reason to pursue his fever dream of a swollen empire. The prickly fact Carney and company are loath to admit is that in parts of Canada, the idea of joining the US is not as radioactive as it ought to be. The proof is in the polling. A recent survey revealed that 18 percent of Conservative voters would be eager, apparently, to swap O Canada for a rousing rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner. Let us pause to consider the jarring significance of this fantastical sentence. Many modern-day ideological descendants of the party of Sir John A MacDonald – one of Canada’s founding fathers, as well as a drunkard and racist – are content to trade in their Canadian citizenship to declare an oath, hand-on-malleable-heart, to America. The sobering story gets even more alarming the further West you venture. According to the same poll, a halting 21 percent of Albertans would say “yes” to being absorbed into Trump’s ugly, disfiguring vision of America, where cruelty and vindictiveness are the defining governing ethos. This is not the petering, verging on irrelevant sovereignty movement that has, at times, traumatised Canada since the late 1950s. This is not Quebec nationalists shielding and asserting their identity, language, and cultural survival. No, this is a loud, disconcerting swath of the West – perpetually angry, isolated, and nursing a decades-long grievance – flirting not just with separation, but pining, it seems, for annexation. For Canada’s cockeyed annexationists, Trump represents salvation from myopic politicians in Ottawa beholden to the stranglehold exercised in election after election by smug voters in Ontario and Quebec. In this stubborn context, Trump’s crude, imperial designs are being treated as an opportunity, not a threat. His pugnacious image of America, with its love for deregulation, muscular independence, and rejection of every stifling ounce of progressiveness, resonates with scores of Canadian Conservatives who feel abandoned by politicians more interested in currying favour with urban, “woke” constituencies in Toronto, Montreal, and beyond. Trump’s combustible rhetoric – couched in the language of “injustice”, exceptionalism, and disdain for “globalist elites” – calls to a brewing sense of disillusionment with the existing state of Confederation among a growing number of Canadians. The president’s calculated provocations – amplified by social media and sympathetic “alternative” news outlets – have bolstered the perception that Canadian federalism is “broken” and that the powers-that-be are not listening. In this corrosive climate, defeated Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre must finally reckon with his role in promoting a narrative, grounded in estrangement and dysfunction, that has deepened divisions and eroded trust in public institutions. In his parochial pursuit of power, Poilievre disparaged the nation he sought to lead, echoing – often almost verbatim – Trump’s seething resentment and polarising bombast. The US president’s cynical efforts to undermine an erstwhile ally’s independence were abetted by a preening politician anxious to declare, again and again, that Canada is crumbling from within. The potentially dire, unintended consequences are now becoming apparent. Like all demagogues, Trump is adept at sniffing out vulnerability and weakness. And while most Canadians remain loyal to the Maple Leaf and are offended to their core by his oafish overtures, fissures are showing. Trump, predictably, is exploiting them with, alternatively, bouts of performative menace and a grating grin. Although she will dismiss the appellation, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith is, by word and deed, the patron saint of the province’s emboldened separatists. Smith’s “Alberta Sovereignty Act” is not the benign assertion of provincial rights her allies inside and outside the legislative assembly claim it to be. This is, in effect, Alberta declaring, sotto voce: “We’ll pick and choose which laws to follow.” It is a blatant rebuff of federalism and an affront to the constitution itself. Smith’s broadsides, denouncing central Canada’s betrayal and control, parallel Trump’s noxious modus operandi. This is not about building pipelines or slashing taxes any more. It is about fomenting a sense of Alberta-as-victim, grooming a citizenry to view Canada not as home, but as an unyielding straitjacket. It is Trumpism in oil-stained cowboy boots. A coalition of national leaders – along what constitutes Canada’s narrow political spectrum – must take seriously the disaffection animating in the West. That means embracing compromise and a wholesale commitment to the imperative that Canada’s always delicate unity cannot be taken for granted. If the curse of alienation spreads, if more and more Westerners see themselves as outsiders in their own country, then the absurd will become the imaginable. Perhaps not annexation, but fragmentation. And with that, the very notion of Canada as a coherent, inclusive nation could soon be at stake. Trump’s pernicious prescriptions are not only a portal into an uncertain future, they pose an existential danger. Canada is confronting the remote, yet conceivable risk, of breaking not with a bang, but by invitation.
